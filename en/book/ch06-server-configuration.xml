  <title>Server Configuration</title>

  <para>A Subversion repository can be accessed simultaneously by
    clients running on the same machine on which the repository
    resides using URLs carrying the <literal>file://</literal> scheme.
    But the typical Subversion setup involves a single server machine
    being accessed from clients on computers all over the
    office&mdash;or, perhaps, all over the world.</para>

  <para>This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository
    exposed outside its host machine for use by remote clients.  We
    will cover Subversion's currently available server mechanisms,
    discussing the configuration and use of each.  After reading this
    chapter, you should be able to decide which networking setup is
    right for your needs, as well as understand how to enable such a
    setup on your host computer.</para>

      </indexterm>Subversion was designed with an abstract repository
      access layer.  This means that a repository can be
      programmatically accessed by any sort of server process, and the
      client <quote>repository access</quote> API allows programmers
      to write plug-ins that speak relevant network protocols.  In
      theory, Subversion can use an infinite number of network
      implementations.  In practice, there are only two Subversion
      servers in widespread use today.</para>

        <see>httpd</see>
      </indexterm>Apache HTTP Server (also known
      as <command>httpd</command>) is an extremely popular web server;
      using the <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module, Apache can
      access a repository and make it available to clients via the
      WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an extension of HTTP.  Because
      Apache is an extremely extensible server, it provides a number
      of features <quote>for free,</quote> such as encrypted SSL
      communication, logging, integration with a number of third-party
      authentication systems, and limited built-in web browsing of
      repositories.</para>

    <para>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>svnserve</primary>
      </indexterm>In the other corner is <command>svnserve</command>:
      a small, lightweight server program that speaks a custom
      protocol with clients.  Because its protocol is explicitly
      designed for Subversion and is stateful (unlike HTTP), it
      provides significantly faster network operations&mdash;but at
      the cost of some features as well.  While it can use SASL to
      provide a variety of authentication and encryption options, it
      has no logging or built-in web browsing.  It is, however,
      extremely easy to set up and is often the best option for small
      teams just starting out with Subversion.</para>

    <para>The network protocol which <command>svnserve</command>
      speaks may also be tunneled over an SSH connection.  This
      deployment option for <command>svnserve</command> differs quite
      a bit in features from a traditional <command>svnserve</command>
      deployment.  SSH is used to encrypt all communication.  SSH is
      also used exclusively to authenticate, so real system accounts
      are required on the server host (unlike
      vanilla <command>svnserve</command>, which has its own private
      user accounts).  Finally, because this setup requires that each
      user spawn a private, temporary <command>svnserve</command>
      process, it's equivalent (from a permissions point of view) to
      allowing a group of local users to all access the repository
      via <literal>file://</literal> URLs.  Path-based access control
      has no meaning, since each user is accessing the repository
      database files directly.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.overview.tbl-1"/> provides a
      quick summary of the three typical server deployments.</para>

    <title>Choosing a Server Configuration</title>

    <para>So, which server should you use?  Which is best?</para>

    <para>Obviously, there's no right answer to that question.  Every
      team has different needs, and the different servers all
      represent different sets of trade-offs.  The Subversion project
      itself doesn't endorse one server or another, or consider either
      server more <quote>official</quote> than another.</para>

    <para>Here are some reasons why you might choose one deployment
      over another, as well as reasons you
      might <emphasis>not</emphasis> choose one.</para>

      <title>Recommendations</title>

      <para>In general, the authors of this book recommend a vanilla
        <command>svnserve</command> installation for small teams just
        trying to get started with a Subversion server; it's the
        simplest to set up and has the fewest maintenance issues.
        You can always switch to a more complex server
        deployment as your needs change.</para>

      <para>Here are some general recommendations and tips, based on
        years of supporting users:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you're trying to set up the simplest possible server
            for your group, a vanilla <command>svnserve</command>
            installation is the easiest, fastest route.  Note,
            however, that your repository data will be transmitted in
            the clear over the network.  If your deployment is
            entirely within your company's LAN or VPN, this isn't an
            issue.  If the repository is exposed to the wide-open
            Internet, you might want to make sure that either the
            repository's contents aren't sensitive (e.g., it contains
            only open source code), or that you go the extra mile in
            configuring SASL to encrypt network communications.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you need to integrate with existing legacy identity
            systems (LDAP, Active Directory, NTLM, X.509, etc.),
            you must use either the Apache-based server
            or <command>svnserve</command> configured with SASL.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you've decided to use either Apache or stock
            <command>svnserve</command>, create a single
            <command>svn</command> user on your system and run the
            server process as that user.  Be sure to make the
            repository directory wholly owned by the
            <command>svn</command> user as well.  From a security
            point of view, this keeps the repository data nicely
            siloed and protected by operating system filesystem
            permissions, changeable by only the Subversion server
            process itself.</para> </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you have an existing infrastructure that is heavily based
            on SSH accounts, and if your users already have system
            accounts on your server machine, it makes sense to
            deploy an <command>svnserve</command>-over-SSH solution.
            Otherwise, we don't widely recommend this option to the
            public.  It's generally considered safer to have your
            users access the repository via (imaginary) accounts
            managed by <command>svnserve</command> or Apache, rather
            than by full-blown system accounts.  If your deep desire
            for encrypted communication still draws you to this
            option, we recommend using Apache with SSL or
            <command>svnserve</command> with SASL encryption
            instead.</para> </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> be seduced by the simple
            idea of having all of your users access a repository
            directly via <literal>file://</literal> URLs.  Even if the
            repository is readily available to everyone via a network
            share, this is a bad idea.  It removes any layers of
            protection between the users and the repository: users can
            accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt the repository
            database, it becomes hard to take the repository offline
            for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a mess of
            file permission problems (see <xref
            linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>).  Note that this
            is also one of the reasons we warn against accessing
            repositories via <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
            URLs&mdash;from a security standpoint, it's effectively
            the same as local users accessing via
            <literal>file://</literal>, and it can entail all the same
            problems if the administrator isn't careful.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>svnserve</primary>
      </indexterm>The <command>svnserve</command> program is a lightweight
      server, capable of speaking to clients over TCP/IP using a
      custom, stateful protocol.  Clients contact an
      <command>svnserve</command> server by using URLs that begin with
      the <literal>svn://</literal> or <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
      scheme.  This section will explain the different ways of running
      <command>svnserve</command>, how clients authenticate themselves
      to the server, and how to configure appropriate access control
      to your repositories.</para>

        <title>svnserve as daemon</title>

        <para>

            <secondary>running</secondary>
            <tertiary>daemon mode</tertiary>
          </indexterm>The easiest option is to run <command>svnserve</command>
          as a standalone <quote>daemon</quote> process.  Use the
          <option>-d</option> option for this:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ svnserve -d
$               # svnserve is now running, listening on port 3690
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>When running <command>svnserve</command> in daemon mode,
          you can use the <option>--listen-port</option> and
          <option>--listen-host</option> options to customize the
          exact port and hostname to <quote>bind</quote> to.</para>

        <para>Once we successfully start <command>svnserve</command>
          as explained previously, it makes every repository on your
          system available to the network.  A client needs to specify
          an <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> path in the repository URL.
          For example, if a repository is located at
          <filename>/var/svn/project1</filename>, a client would reach
          it via <uri>svn://host.example.com/var/svn/project1</uri>.
          To increase security, you can pass the <option>-r</option>
          option to <command>svnserve</command>, which restricts it to
          exporting only repositories below that path.  For
          example:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ svnserve -d -r /var/svn
&hellip;
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Using the <option>-r</option> option effectively
          modifies the location that the program treats as the root of
          the remote filesystem space.  Clients then use URLs that
          have that path portion removed from them, leaving much
          shorter (and much less revealing) URLs:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ svn checkout svn://host.example.com/project1
&hellip;
</screen>
        </informalexample>

          </indexterm>If you want <command>inetd</command> to launch the
          process, you need to pass the <option>-i</option>
          (<option>--inetd</option>) option.  In the following
          example, we've shown the output from running
          <literal>svnserve -i</literal> at the command line, but note
          that this isn't how you actually start the daemon; see the
          paragraphs following the example for how to configure
          <command>inetd</command> to start
          <command>svnserve</command>.</para>

        <para>When invoked with the <option>--inetd</option> option,
          <command>svnserve</command> attempts to speak with a
          Subversion client via <filename>stdin</filename> and
          <filename>stdout</filename> using a custom protocol.  This
          is the standard behavior for a program being run via
          <command>inetd</command>.  The IANA has reserved port 3690
          for the Subversion protocol, so on a Unix-like system you
          can add lines to <filename>/etc/services</filename> such as
          these (if they don't already exist):</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>

svn           3690/udp   # Subversion
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>If your system is using a classic Unix-like
          <command>inetd</command> daemon, you can add this line to
          <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
svn stream tcp nowait svnowner /usr/bin/svnserve svnserve -i
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Make sure <quote>svnowner</quote> is a user that has
          appropriate permissions to access your repositories.  Now,
          when a client connection comes into your server on port
          3690, <command>inetd</command> will spawn an
          <command>svnserve</command> process to service it.  Of
          course, you may also want to add <option>-r</option> to the
          configuration line as well, to restrict which repositories
          are exported.</para>

            <tertiary>tunnel mode</tertiary>
          </indexterm>Another way to invoke <command>svnserve</command> is in
          tunnel mode, using the <option>-t</option> option.  This
          mode assumes that a remote-service program such as
          <command>rsh</command> or <command>ssh</command> has
          successfully authenticated a user and is now invoking a
          private <command>svnserve</command> process <emphasis>as
          that user</emphasis>.  (Note that you, the user, will
          rarely, if ever, have reason to invoke
          <command>svnserve</command> with the <option>-t</option> at
          the command line; instead, the SSH daemon
          does so for you.)  The <command>svnserve</command> program
          behaves normally (communicating via
          <filename>stdin</filename> and <filename>stdout</filename>)
          and assumes that the traffic is being automatically
          redirected over some sort of tunnel back to the client.
          When <command>svnserve</command> is invoked by a tunnel
          agent like this, be sure that the authenticated user has
          full read and write access to the repository database files.
          It's essentially the same as a local user accessing the
          repository via <literal>file://</literal> URLs.</para>

        <title>svnserve as a Windows service</title>

            <secondary>running</secondary>
            <tertiary>as Windows service</tertiary>
          </indexterm>If your Windows system is a descendant of Windows NT
          (Windows 2000 or newer), you can
          run <command>svnserve</command> as a standard Windows
          service.  This is typically a much nicer experience than
          running it as a standalone daemon with
          the <option>--daemon</option> (<option>-d</option>) option.
          Using daemon mode requires launching a console, typing a
          command, and then leaving the console window running
          indefinitely.  A Windows service, however, runs in the
          background, can start at boot time automatically, and can be
          started and stopped using the same consistent administration
          interface as other Windows services.</para>

        <para>You'll need to define the new service using the
          command-line tool <command>SC.EXE</command>.  Much like
          the <command>inetd</command> configuration line, you must
          specify an exact invocation of <command>svnserve</command>
          for Windows to run at startup time:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "C:\svn\bin\svnserve.exe --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>This defines a new Windows service named
          <literal>svn</literal> which executes a particular
          <command>svnserve.exe</command> command when started (in
          this case, rooted at <filename>C:\repos</filename>).  There
          are a number of caveats in the prior example,
          however.</para>

        <para>First, notice that the <command>svnserve.exe</command>
          program must always be invoked with the
          <option>--service</option> option.  Any other options to
          <command>svnserve</command> must then be specified on the
          same line, but you cannot add conflicting options such as
          <option>--daemon</option>
          (<option>-d</option>), <option>--tunnel</option>,
          or <option>--inetd</option> (<option>-i</option>).  Options
          such as <option>-r</option>
          or <option>--listen-port</option> are fine, though.  Second,
          be careful about spaces when invoking
          the <command>SC.EXE</command> command: the <literal>key=
          value</literal> patterns must have no spaces between
          <literal>key=</literal> and must have exactly one space
          before the <literal>value</literal>.  Lastly, be careful
          about spaces in your command line to be invoked.  If a
          directory name contains spaces (or other characters that
          need escaping), place the entire inner value of
          <literal>binpath</literal> in double quotes, by escaping
          them:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Also note that the word <literal>binpath</literal> is
          misleading&mdash;its value is a <emphasis>command
          line</emphasis>, not the path to an executable.  That's why
          you need to surround it with quotes if it contains
          embedded spaces.</para>

        <para>Once the service is defined, it can be stopped, started,
          or queried using standard GUI tools (the Services
          administrative control panel), or at the command
          line:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
C:\&gt; net stop svn
C:\&gt; net start svn
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The service can also be uninstalled (i.e., undefined) by
          deleting its definition:  <userinput>sc delete svn</userinput>.
          Just be sure to stop the service first!
          The <command>SC.EXE</command> program has many other
          subcommands and options; run <userinput>sc /?</userinput> to
          learn more about it.</para>

          <para>The <command>launchd</command> system can be somewhat
            challenging to learn.  Fortunately, documentation exists
            for the commands described in this section. For example,
            run <userinput>man launchd</userinput> from the command
            line to see the manual page for <command>launchd</command>
            itself, <userinput>man launchd.plist</userinput> to read
            about the job definition format, etc.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>Once your job definition file is created, you can
          activate the job using <command>launchctl load</command>:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ sudo launchctl load \
       -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.subversion.svnserve.plist
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>To be clear, this action doesn't actually launch
          <command>svnserve</command> yet.  It simply tells
          <command>launchd</command> how to fire up
          <command>svnserve</command> when incoming networking traffic
          arrives on the <literal>svn</literal> network port; it will
          be terminated it after the traffic has been handled.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Because we want <command>svnserve</command> to be a
            system-wide daemon process, we need to
            use <command>sudo</command> to manage this job as an
            administrator.  Note also that the
            <literal>UserName</literal>
            and <literal>GroupName</literal> keys in the definition
            file are optional&mdash;if omitted, the job will run as
            the user who loaded the job.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Deactivating the job is just as easy to do&mdash;use
          <command>launchctl unload</command>:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ sudo launchctl unload \
       -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.subversion.svnserve.plist
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para><command>launchctl</command> also provides a way for you
          to query the status of jobs.  If the job is loaded, there
          will be line which matches the <literal>Label</literal>
          specified in the job definition file:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ sudo launchctl list | grep org.apache.subversion.svnserve
-       0       org.apache.subversion.svnserve
$

        the server sends a small amount of data to the client.  The
        client uses the MD5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of
        the data and password combined, and then sends the fingerprint
        as a response.  The server performs the same computation with

      <para>If your <command>svnserve</command> server was built with

      <para>It's also possible, of course, for the client to be
        externally authenticated via a tunnel agent, such as
        <command>ssh</command>.  In that case, the server simply
        examines the user it's running as, and uses this name as the
        authenticated username.  For more on this, see the later
        section, <xref
        linkend="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth"/>.</para>

      <para>As you've already guessed, a repository's
        <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file is the central
        mechanism for controlling authentication and authorization
        policies.  The file has the same format as other configuration
        files (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>):
        section names are marked by square brackets
        (<literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal>), comments
        begin with hashes (<literal>#</literal>), and each section
        contains specific variables that can be set (<literal>variable
        = value</literal>).  Let's walk through these files and learn
        how to use them.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth.users">
        <title>Create a users file and realm</title>

        <para>For now, the <literal>[general]</literal> section of
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> has all the variables you
          need.  Begin by changing the values of those variables:
          choose a name for a file that will contain your usernames
          and passwords and choose an authentication realm:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The <literal>realm</literal> is a name that you define.
          It tells clients which sort of <quote>authentication
          namespace</quote> they're connecting to; the Subversion
          client displays it in the authentication prompt and uses it
          as a key (along with the server's hostname and port) for
          caching credentials on disk (see <xref
          linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  The
          <literal>password-db</literal> variable points to a separate
          file that contains a list of usernames and passwords, using
          the same familiar format.  For example:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[users]
harry = foopassword
sally = barpassword
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The value of <literal>password-db</literal> can be an
          absolute or relative path to the users file.  For many
          admins, it's easy to keep the file right in the
          <filename>conf/</filename> area of the repository, alongside
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>.  On the other hand, it's
          possible you may want to have two or more repositories share
          the same users file; in that case, the file should probably
          live in a more public place.  The repositories sharing the
          users file should also be configured to have the same realm,
          since the list of users essentially defines an
          authentication realm.  Wherever the file lives, be sure to
          set the file's read and write permissions appropriately.  If
          you know which user(s) <command>svnserve</command> will run
          as, restrict read access to the users file as necessary.</para>

        <title>Set access controls</title>

        <para>There are two more variables to set in the
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file: they determine what
          unauthenticated (anonymous) and authenticated users are
          allowed to do.  The variables <literal>anon-access</literal>
          and <literal>auth-access</literal> can be set to the value
          <literal>none</literal>, <literal>read</literal>, or
          <literal>write</literal>.  Setting the value to
          <literal>none</literal> prohibits both reading and writing;
          <literal>read</literal> allows read-only access to the
          repository, and <literal>write</literal> allows complete
          read/write access to the repository.  For example:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users can only read the repository
anon-access = read

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The example settings are, in fact, the default values of
          the variables, should you forget to define them.  If you
          want to be even more conservative, you can block anonymous
          access completely:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users aren't allowed
anon-access = none

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The server process understands not only
          these <quote>blanket</quote> access controls to the
          repository, but also finer-grained access restrictions
          placed on specific files and directories within the
          repository.  To make use of this feature, you need to define
          a file containing more detailed rules, and then set
          the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable to point to
          it:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# Specific access rules for specific locations
authz-db = authzfile
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>We discuss the syntax of the <filename>authzfile</filename> file
          in detail later in this chapter, in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz"/>.  Note
          that the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable isn't mutually
          exclusive with the <literal>anon-access</literal>
          and <literal>auth-access</literal> variables;  if all the
          variables are defined at once, <emphasis>all</emphasis>
          of the rules must be satisfied before access is allowed.</para>

      <title>Using svnserve with SASL</title>

      <para>For many teams, the built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication is
        all they need from <command>svnserve</command>.  However, if
        your server (and your Subversion clients) were built with the
        Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) library,
        you have a number of authentication and encryption
        options available to you.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>What Is SASL?</title>

        <para>The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is
          open source software written by Carnegie Mellon University.
          It adds generic authentication and encryption capabilities
          to any network protocol, and as of Subversion 1.5 and later,
          both the <command>svnserve</command> server
          and <command>svn</command> client know how to make use of
          this library.  It may or may not be available to you: if
          you're building Subversion yourself, you'll need to have at
          least version 2.1 of SASL installed on your system, and
          you'll need to make sure that it's detected during
          Subversion's build process.  The Subversion command-line
          client will report the availability of Cyrus SASL when you
          run <userinput>svn --version</userinput>; if you're using
          some other Subversion client, you might need to check with
          the package maintainer as to whether SASL support was
          compiled in.</para>

        <para>SASL comes with a number of pluggable modules that
          represent different authentication systems: Kerberos
          (GSSAPI), NTLM, One-Time-Passwords (OTP), DIGEST-MD5, LDAP,
          Secure-Remote-Password (SRP), and others.  Certain
          mechanisms may or may not be available to you; be sure to
          check which modules are provided.</para>

        <para>You can download Cyrus SASL (both code and
          documentation) from
          <ulink url="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html"
          />.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Normally, when a subversion client connects to
        <command>svnserve</command>, the server sends a greeting that
        advertises a list of the capabilities it supports, and the
        client responds with a similar list of capabilities.  If the
        server is configured to require authentication, it then sends
        a challenge that lists the authentication mechanisms
        available; the client responds by choosing one of the
        mechanisms, and then authentication is carried out in some
        number of round-trip messages.  Even when SASL capabilities
        aren't present, the client and server inherently know how to
        use the CRAM-MD5 and ANONYMOUS mechanisms (see
        <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth"/>).  If server
        and client were linked against SASL, a number of other
        authentication mechanisms may also be available.  However,
        you'll need to explicitly configure SASL on the server side to
        advertise them.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.authn">
        <title>Authenticating with SASL</title>

        <para>To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server,
          you'll need to do two things.  First, create
          a <literal>[sasl]</literal> section in your
          repository's <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file with an
          initial key-value pair:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Second, create a main SASL configuration file
          called <filename>svn.conf</filename> in a place where the
          SASL library can find it&mdash;typically in the directory
          where SASL plug-ins are located.  You'll have to locate the
          plug-in directory on your particular system, such
          as <filename>/usr/lib/sasl2/</filename>
          or <filename>/etc/sasl2/</filename>.  (Note that this
          is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          the <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file that lives
          within a repository!)</para>

        <para>On a Windows server, you'll also have to edit the system
          registry (using a tool such as <command>regedit</command>)
          to tell SASL where to find things.  Create a registry key
          named <literal>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie
          Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library]</literal>, and place two
          keys inside it: a key called <literal>SearchPath</literal>
          (whose value is a path to the directory containing the SASL
          <filename>sasl*.dll</filename> plug-in libraries), and a key
          called
          <literal>ConfFile</literal> (whose value is a path to the
          parent directory containing
          the <filename>svn.conf</filename> file you created).</para>

        <para>Because SASL provides so many different kinds of
          authentication mechanisms, it would be foolish (and far
          beyond the scope of this book) to try to describe every
          possible server-side configuration.  Instead, we recommend
          that you read the documentation supplied in the
          <filename>doc/</filename> subdirectory of the SASL source
          code.  It goes into great detail about every mechanism and
          how to configure the server appropriately for each.  For the
          purposes of this discussion, we'll just demonstrate a simple
          example of configuring the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism.  For
          example, if your <filename>subversion.conf</filename>
          (or <filename>svn.conf</filename>) file contains the
          following:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
sasldb_path: /etc/my_sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>you've told SASL to advertise the DIGEST-MD5
          mechanism to clients and to check user passwords against a
          private password database located
          at <filename>/etc/my_sasldb</filename>.  A system
          administrator can then use
          the <command>saslpasswd2</command> program to add or modify
          usernames and passwords in the database:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ saslpasswd2 -c -f /etc/my_sasldb -u realm username
</screen>
        </informalexample>

        <para>A few words of warning: first, make sure the
          <quote>realm</quote> argument
          to <command>saslpasswd2</command> matches the same realm
          you've defined in your
          repository's <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file; if
          they don't match, authentication will fail.  Also, due to a
          shortcoming in SASL, the common realm must be a string with
          no space characters.  Finally, if you decide to go with the
          standard SASL password database, make sure
          the <command>svnserve</command> program has read access to
          the file (and possibly write access as well, if you're using
          a mechanism such as OTP).</para>

        <para>This is just one simple way of configuring SASL.  Many
          other authentication mechanisms are available, and passwords
          can be stored in other places such as in LDAP or a SQL
          database.  Consult the full SASL documentation for
          details.</para>

        <para>Remember that if you configure your server to only allow
          certain SASL authentication mechanisms, this forces all
          connecting clients to have SASL support as well.  Any
          Subversion client built without SASL support (which includes
          all pre-1.5 clients) will be unable to authenticate.  On the
          one hand, this sort of restriction may be exactly what you
          want (<quote>My clients must all use Kerberos!</quote>).
          However, if you still want non-SASL clients to be able to
          authenticate, be sure to advertise the CRAM-MD5 mechanism as
          an option.  All clients are able to use CRAM-MD5, whether
          they have SASL capabilities or not.</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.encryption">
        <title>SASL encryption</title>

        <para>SASL is also able to perform data encryption if a
          particular mechanism supports it.  The built-in CRAM-MD5
          mechanism doesn't support encryption, but DIGEST-MD5 does,
          and mechanisms such as SRP actually require use of the
          OpenSSL library.  To enable or disable different levels of
          encryption, you can set two values in your repository's
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The <literal>min-encryption</literal> and
          <literal>max-encryption</literal> variables control the
          level of encryption demanded by the server.  To disable
          encryption completely, set both values to 0.  To enable
          simple checksumming of data (i.e., prevent tampering and
          guarantee data integrity without encryption), set both
          values to 1.  If you wish to allow&mdash;but not
          require&mdash;encryption, set the minimum value to 0, and
          the maximum value to some bit length.  To require encryption
          unconditionally, set both values to numbers greater than 1.
          In our previous example, we require clients to do at least
          128-bit encryption, but no more than 256-bit
          encryption.</para>

      <title>Tunneling over SSH</title>

      <para><command>svnserve</command>'s built-in authentication (and
        SASL support) can be very handy, because it avoids the need to
        create real system accounts.  On the other hand, some
        administrators already have well-established SSH
        authentication frameworks in place.  In these situations, all
        of the project's users already have system accounts and the
        ability to <quote>SSH into</quote> the server machine.</para>

      <para>It's easy to use SSH in conjunction with
        <command>svnserve</command>.  The client simply uses the
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URL scheme to connect:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <screen>
$ whoami
harry

$ svn list svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project
harryssh@host.example.com's password:  *****

foo
bar
baz
&hellip;
</screen>
      </informalexample>

      <para>In this example, the Subversion client is invoking a local
        <command>ssh</command> process, connecting to
        <literal>host.example.com</literal>, authenticating as the
        user <literal>harryssh</literal> (according to SSH user
        configuration), then spawning a private
        <command>svnserve</command> process on the remote machine
        running as the user <literal>harryssh</literal>.  The
        <command>svnserve</command> command is being invoked in tunnel
        mode (<option>-t</option>), and its network protocol is being
        <quote>tunneled</quote> over the encrypted connection by
        <command>ssh</command>, the tunnel agent.
        If the client performs a commit, the authenticated username
        <literal>harryssh</literal> will be used as the author
        of the new revision.</para>

      <para>The important thing to understand here is that the
        Subversion client is <emphasis>not</emphasis> connecting to a
        running <command>svnserve</command> daemon.  This method of
        access doesn't require a daemon, nor does it notice one if
        present.  It relies wholly on the ability of
        <command>ssh</command> to spawn a temporary
        <command>svnserve</command> process, which then terminates
        when the network connection is closed.</para>

      <para>When using <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs to access a
        repository, remember that it's the <command>ssh</command>
        program prompting for authentication, and
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> the <command>svn</command> client
        program.  That means there's no automatic password-caching
        going on (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).
        The Subversion client often makes multiple connections to the
        repository, though users don't normally notice this due to the
        password caching feature.  When using
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs, however, users may be
        annoyed by <command>ssh</command> repeatedly asking for a
        password for every outbound connection.  The solution is to
        use a separate SSH password-caching tool such as
        <command>ssh-agent</command> on a Unix-like system, or
        <command>pageant</command> on Windows.</para>

      <para>When running over a tunnel, authorization is primarily
        controlled by operating system permissions to the repository's
        database files; it's very much the same as if Harry were
        accessing the repository directly via a
        <literal>file://</literal> URL.  If multiple system users are
        going to be accessing the repository directly, you may want to
        place them into a common group, and you'll need to be careful
        about umasks (be sure to read <xref
        linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/> later in this
        chapter).  But even in the case of tunneling, you can still use the
        <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file to block access, by
        simply setting <literal>auth-access = read</literal>
        or <literal>auth-access = none</literal>.<footnote><para>Note
        that using any sort of <command>svnserve</command>-enforced
        access control at all only makes sense if the users cannot 
        bypass it and access the repository directory directly using
        other tools (such as <command>cd</command> and
        <command>vi</command>); implementing
        such restrictions is described in
        <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.fixedcmd"
        />.</para></footnote></para>

      <para>You'd think that the story of SSH tunneling would end
        here, but it doesn't.  Subversion allows you to create custom
        tunnel behaviors in your runtime <filename>config</filename>
        file (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>).  For
        example, suppose you want to use RSH instead of
        SSH.<footnote><para>We don't actually recommend this, since
        RSH is notably less secure than SSH.</para></footnote>  In
        the <literal>[tunnels]</literal> section of your
        <filename>config</filename> file, simply define it like
        this:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[tunnels]
rsh = rsh
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>And now, you can use this new tunnel definition by using a
        URL scheme that matches the name of your new variable:
        <literal>svn+rsh://host/path</literal>.  When using the new
        URL scheme, the Subversion client will actually be running the
        command <userinput>rsh host svnserve -t</userinput> behind the
        scenes.  If you include a username in the URL (e.g.,
        <literal>svn+rsh://username@host/path</literal>), the client
        will also include that in its command (<userinput>rsh
        username@host svnserve -t</userinput>).  But you can define new
        tunneling schemes to be much more clever than that:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[tunnels]
joessh = $JOESSH /opt/alternate/ssh -p 29934
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>This example demonstrates a couple of things.  First, it
        shows how to make the Subversion client launch a very specific
        tunneling binary (the one located at
        <filename>/opt/alternate/ssh</filename>) with specific
        options.  In this case, accessing an
        <literal>svn+joessh://</literal> URL would invoke the
        particular SSH binary with <option>-p 29934</option> as
        arguments&mdash;useful if you want the tunnel program to
        connect to a nonstandard port.</para>

      <para>Second, it shows how to define a custom environment
        variable that can override the name of the tunneling program.
        Setting the <literal>SVN_SSH</literal> environment variable is
        a convenient way to override the default SSH tunnel agent.
        But if you need to have several different overrides for
        different servers, each perhaps contacting a different port or
        passing a different set of options to SSH, you can use the
        mechanism demonstrated in this example.  Now if we were to set
        the <literal>JOESSH</literal> environment variable, its value
        would override the entire value of the tunnel
        variable&mdash;<command>$JOESSH</command> would be executed
        instead of <userinput>/opt/alternate/ssh -p
        29934</userinput>.</para>

      <para>It's possible to control not only the way in which the

        the behavior of <command>sshd</command> on your server

        by <command>sshd</command>, as well as how to have multiple
        users share a single system account.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.setup">
        <title>Initial setup</title>

        <para>To begin, locate the home directory of the account
          you'll be using to launch <command>svnserve</command>.  Make
          sure the account has an SSH public/private keypair
          installed, and that the user can log in via public-key
          authentication.  Password authentication will not work,
          since all of the following SSH tricks revolve around using
          the SSH <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file.</para>

        <para>If it doesn't already exist, create the
          <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file (on Unix,
          typically <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>).
          Each line in this file describes a public key that is
          allowed to connect.  The lines are typically of the
          form:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
  ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch&hellip; user@example.com
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>The first field describes the type of key, the second
          field is the base64-encoded key itself, and the third field
          is a comment.  However, it's a lesser known fact that the
          entire line can be preceded by a <literal>command</literal>
          field:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
  command="program" ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch&hellip; user@example.com
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>When the <literal>command</literal> field is set, the
          SSH daemon will run the named program instead of the
          typical tunnel-mode <command>svnserve</command> invocation that the
          Subversion client asks for.  This opens the door to a number
          of server-side tricks.  In the following examples, we
          abbreviate the lines of the file as:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
  command="program" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.fixedcmd">
        <title>Controlling the invoked command</title>

        <para>Because we can specify the executed server-side command,
          it's easy to name a specific <command>svnserve</command>
          binary to run and to pass it extra arguments:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
  command="/path/to/svnserve -t -r /virtual/root" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>In this example, <filename>/path/to/svnserve</filename>
          might be a custom wrapper script
          around <command>svnserve</command> which sets the umask (see
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>).  It also
          shows how to anchor <command>svnserve</command> in a virtual
          root directory, just as one often does when
          running <command>svnserve</command> as a daemon process.
          This might be done either to restrict access to parts of the
          system, or simply to relieve the user of having to type an
          absolute path in the <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
          URL.</para>

        <para>It's also possible to have multiple users share a single
          account.  Instead of creating a separate system account for
          each user, generate a public/private key pair for each
          person.  Then place each public key into
          the <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file, one per
          line, and use the <option>--tunnel-user</option>
          option:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry" TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=sally" TYPE2 KEY2 sally@example.com
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>This example allows both Harry and Sally to connect to
          the same account via public key authentication.  Each of
          them has a custom command that will be executed;
          the <option>--tunnel-user</option> option
          tells <command>svnserve</command> to assume that the named
          argument is the authenticated user.  Without
          <option>--tunnel-user</option>, it would appear as though
          all commits were coming from the one shared system
          account.</para>

        <para>A final word of caution: giving a user access to the
          server via public-key in a shared account might still allow
          other forms of SSH access, even if you've set
          the <literal>command</literal> value
          in <filename>authorized_keys</filename>.  For example, the
          user may still get shell access through SSH or be able to
          perform X11 or general port forwarding through your server.
          To give the user as little permission as possible, you may
          want to specify a number of restrictive options immediately
          after the <literal>command</literal>:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forw
arding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Note that this all must be on one line&mdash;truly on
          one line&mdash;since SSH <filename>authorized_keys</filename>
          files do not even allow the conventional backslash character
          (<literal>\</literal>) for line continuation.  The only
          reason we've shown it with a line break is to fit it on
          the physical page of a book.</para>

      <title>svnserve Configuration Reference</title>

      <para>In the previous sections, we've mentioned numerous
        configuration options that administrators can use in their
        <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> files to configure the
        behavior of Subversion as accessed via Subversion's
        <command>svnserve</command> server option.  In this section,
        we'll quickly summarize <emphasis>all</emphasis> the
        configuration options supported by this server.</para>

      <para>The <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> configuration file
        uses a typical INI-style format, with name/value pairs of
        options grouped into named sections.  (This is conveniently
        the same format used by Subversion's runtime configuration
        area on the client side of the network.)  We'll describe
        herein each of those named sections and the options available
        for use within them.</para>

      <para>By default, <command>svnserve</command> will consult
        per-repository configuration files located
        at <filename>conf/svnserve.conf</filename> within the physical
        directory structure of the repository.  To instead use a
        single configuration file whose values apply to all
        repositories served via an instance
        of <command>svnserve</command>, use
        the <option>--config-file</option> option when starting your
        server.</para>

      <note>
        <para>In the following sections, we will refer to
          the <command>svnserve</command> configuration file by its
          canonical name, <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>.  The
          filename of actual configuration file used by
          your <command>svnserve</command> instance might be something

    <title>httpd, the Apache HTTP Server</title>

    <para>The Apache HTTP Server is a <quote>heavy-duty</quote>
      network server that Subversion can leverage.  Via a custom
      module, <command>httpd</command> makes Subversion repositories
      available to clients via the WebDAV/DeltaV<footnote><para>See
      <ulink url="http://www.webdav.org/"/>.</para></footnote>
      protocol, which is an extension to HTTP 1.1.  This protocol
      takes the ubiquitous HTTP protocol that is the core of the World
      Wide Web, and adds writing&mdash;specifically, versioned
      writing&mdash;capabilities.  The result is a standardized,
      robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
      Apache 2.0 software, supported by numerous operating systems and
      third-party products, and doesn't require network administrators
      to open up yet another custom port.<footnote><para>They really
      hate doing that.</para></footnote> While an Apache-Subversion
      server has more features than <command>svnserve</command>, it's
      also a bit more difficult to set up.  With flexibility often
      comes more complexity.</para>

    <para>Much of the following discussion includes references to
      Apache configuration directives.  While some examples are given
      of the use of these directives, describing them in full is
      outside the scope of this chapter.  The Apache team maintains
      excellent documentation, publicly available on their web site at
      <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org"/>.  For example, a general
      reference for the configuration directives is located at
      <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/directives.html"
      />.</para>

    <para>Also, as you make changes to your Apache setup, it is likely
      that somewhere along the way a mistake will be made.  If you are
      not already familiar with Apache's logging subsystem, you should
      become aware of it.  In your <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
      file are directives that specify the on-disk locations of the
      access and error logs generated by Apache (the
      <literal>CustomLog</literal> and <literal>ErrorLog</literal>
      directives, respectively).
      Subversion's <command>mod_dav_svn</command> uses Apache's error
      logging interface as well.  You can always browse the contents
      of those files for information that might reveal the source of a
      problem that is not clearly noticeable otherwise.</para>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>To network your repository over HTTP, you basically need
        four components, available in two packages.  You'll need
        Apache <command>httpd</command> 2.0 or newer, the
        <command>mod_dav</command> DAV module that comes with it,
        Subversion, and the <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
        filesystem provider module distributed with Subversion.
        Once you have all of those components, the process of
        networking your repository is as simple as:</para>

        <listitem>

      <para>You can accomplish the first two items either by
        compiling <command>httpd</command> and Subversion from
        source code or by installing prebuilt binary packages of
        them on your system.  For the most up-to-date information on
        how to compile Subversion for use with the Apache HTTP Server,
        as well as how to compile and configure Apache itself for
        this purpose, see the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file in
        the top level of the Subversion source code tree.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.basic">
      <title>Basic Apache Configuration</title>

      <para>Once you have all the necessary components installed on
        your system, all that remains is the configuration of Apache
        via its <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file.  Instruct Apache
        to load the <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module using the
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive.  This directive must
        precede any other Subversion-related configuration items.  If
        your Apache was installed using the default layout, your
        <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module should have been
        installed in the <filename>modules</filename> subdirectory of
        the Apache install location (often
        <filename>/usr/local/apache2</filename>).  The
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive has a simple syntax,
        mapping a named module to the location of a shared library on
        disk:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Apache interprets the <literal>LoadModule</literal>
        configuration item's library path as relative to its own
        server root.  If configured as previously shown, Apache will
        look for the Subversion DAV module shared library in its
        own <filename>modules/</filename> subdirectory.  Depending on
        how Subversion was installed on your system, you might need to
        specify a different path for this library altogether, perhaps
        even an absolute path such as in the following example:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
LoadModule dav_svn_module     C:/Subversion/lib/mod_dav_svn.so
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Note that if <command>mod_dav</command> was compiled as a
        shared object (instead of statically linked directly to the
        <command>httpd</command> binary), you'll need a similar
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> statement for it, too.  Be sure
        that it comes before the <command>mod_dav_svn</command> line:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>At a later location in your configuration file, you now
        need to tell Apache where you keep your Subversion repository
        (or repositories).  The <literal>Location</literal> directive
        has an XML-like notation, starting with an opening tag and
        ending with a closing tag, with various other configuration
        directives in the middle.  The purpose of the
        <literal>Location</literal> directive is to instruct Apache to
        do something special when handling requests that are directed
        at a given URL or one of its children.  In the case of
        Subversion, you want Apache to simply hand off support for
        URLs that point at versioned resources to the DAV layer.  You
        can instruct Apache to delegate the handling of all URLs whose
        path portions (the part of the URL that follows the server's
        name and the optional port number) begin with
        <filename>/repos/</filename> to a DAV provider whose
        repository is located at
        <filename>/var/svn/repository</filename> using the
        following <filename>httpd.conf</filename> syntax:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>If you plan to support multiple Subversion repositories
        that will reside in the same parent directory on your local
        disk, you can use an alternative
        directive&mdash;<literal>SVNParentPath</literal>&mdash;to
        indicate that common parent directory.  For example, if you
        know you will be creating multiple Subversion repositories in
        a directory <filename>/var/svn</filename> that would be
        accessed via URLs such as
        <uri>http://my.server.com/svn/repos1</uri>,
        <uri>http://my.server.com/svn/repos2</uri>, and so on, you
        could use the <filename>httpd.conf</filename> configuration
        syntax in the following example:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn

  # Automatically map any "/svn/foo" URL to repository /var/svn/foo
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Using this syntax, Apache will delegate the
        handling of all URLs whose path portions begin with
        <filename>/svn/</filename> to the Subversion DAV provider,
        which will then assume that any items in the directory
        specified by the <literal>SVNParentPath</literal> directive
        are actually Subversion repositories.  This is a particularly
        convenient syntax in that, unlike the use of the
        <literal>SVNPath</literal> directive, you don't have to
        restart Apache to add or remove hosted repositories.</para>

      <para>Be sure that when you define your new
        <literal>Location</literal>, it doesn't overlap with other
        exported locations.  For example, if your main
        <literal>DocumentRoot</literal> is exported to
        <filename>/www</filename>, do not export a Subversion
        repository in <literal>&lt;Location /www/repos&gt;</literal>.
        If a request comes in for the URI
        <filename>/www/repos/foo.c</filename>, Apache won't know
        whether to look for a file <filename>repos/foo.c</filename> in
        the <literal>DocumentRoot</literal>, or whether to delegate
        <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to return
        <filename>foo.c</filename> from the Subversion repository.
        The result is often an error from the server of the form
        <literal>301 Moved Permanently</literal>.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Server Names and the COPY Request</title>

        <para>Subversion makes use of the <literal>COPY</literal>
          request type to perform server-side copies of files and
          directories.  As part of the sanity checking done by the
          Apache modules, the source of the copy is expected to be
          located on the same machine as the destination of the copy.
          To satisfy this requirement, you might need to
          tell <command>mod_dav</command> the name you use as the
          hostname of your server.  Generally, you can use
          the <literal>ServerName</literal> directive in
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename> to accomplish this.</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
ServerName svn.example.com
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>If you are using Apache's virtual hosting support via
          the <literal>NameVirtualHost</literal> directive, you may
          need to use the <literal>ServerAlias</literal> directive to
          specify additional names by which your server is known.
          Again, refer to the Apache documentation for full
          details.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>At this stage, you should strongly consider the question
        of permissions.  If you've been running Apache for some time
        now as your regular web server, you probably already have a
        collection of content&mdash;web pages, scripts, and such.
        These items have already been configured with a set of
        permissions that allows them to work with Apache, or more
        appropriately, that allows Apache to work with those files.
        Apache, when used as a Subversion server, will also need the
        correct permissions to read and write to your Subversion
        repository.</para>

      <para>You will need to determine a permission system setup that
        satisfies Subversion's requirements without messing up any
        previously existing web page or script installations.  This
        might mean changing the permissions on your Subversion
        repository to match those in use by other things that Apache
        serves for you, or it could mean using the
        <literal>User</literal> and <literal>Group</literal>
        directives in <filename>httpd.conf</filename> to specify that
        Apache should run as the user and group that owns your
        Subversion repository.  There is no single correct way to set
        up your permissions, and each administrator will have
        different reasons for doing things a certain way.  Just be
        aware that permission-related problems are perhaps the most
        common oversight when configuring a Subversion repository for
        use with Apache.</para>

        <title>Basic authentication</title>

        <para>The easiest way to authenticate a client is via the HTTP
          Basic authentication mechanism, which simply uses a username
          and password to verify a user's identity.  Apache provides
          the <command>htpasswd</command> utility<footnote><para>See
          <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html"
          />.</para></footnote> for managing files containing
          usernames and passwords.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Basic authentication is <emphasis>extremely</emphasis>
            insecure, because it sends passwords over the network
            in very nearly plain text.  See
            <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn.digest"/> for
            details on using the much safer Digest mechanism.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>First, create a password file and grant access to
          users Harry and Sally:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <screen>
$ ### First time: use -c to create the file
$ ### Use -m to use MD5 encryption of the password, which is more secure
$ htpasswd -c -m /etc/svn-auth.htpasswd harry
New password: *****
Re-type new password: *****
Adding password for user harry
$ htpasswd -m /etc/svn-auth.htpasswd sally
New password: *******
Re-type new password: *******
Adding password for user sally
$
</screen>
        </informalexample>
        
        <para>Next, ensure that Apache has access to the modules which
          provide the Basic authentication and related
          functionality:  <literal>mod_auth_basic</literal>,
          <literal>mod_authn_file</literal>, and
          <literal>mod_authz_user</literal>.  In many cases, these
          modules are compiled into <command>httpd</command> itself,
          but if not, you might need to explicitly load one or more of
          them using the <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
LoadModule auth_basic_module   modules/mod_auth_basic.so
LoadModule authn_file_module   modules/mod_authn_file.so
LoadModule authz_user_module   moduels/mod_authz_user.so
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>After ensuring the Apache has access to the required
          functionality, you'll need to add some more directives
          inside the <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block to tell
          Apache what type of authentication you wish to use, and just
          how to to so:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Basic
  AuthBasicProvider file
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htpasswd
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>These directives work as follows:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>AuthName</literal> is an arbitrary name
              that you choose for the authentication domain.  Most
              browsers display this name in the dialog box when
              prompting for username and password.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>AuthType</literal> specifies the type of
              authentication to use.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>AuthBasicProvider</literal> specifies the
              Basic authentication provider to use for the location.
              In our example, we wish to consult a local password
              file.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>AuthUserFile</literal> specifies the
              location of the password file to use.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>However, this <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block
          doesn't yet do anything useful.  It merely tells Apache that
          <emphasis>if</emphasis> authorization were required, it
          should challenge the Subversion client for a username and
          password.  (When authorization is required, Apache requires
          authentication as well.)  What's missing here, however, are
          directives that tell Apache <emphasis>which sorts</emphasis>
          of client requests require authorization; currently, none do.
          The simplest thing is to specify that <emphasis>all</emphasis>
          requests require authorization by adding
          <literal>Require valid-user</literal> to the block:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Basic
  AuthBasicProvider file
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htpasswd

  # Authorization: Authenticated users only
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Refer to <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz"/>
          for more detail on the <literal>Require</literal> directive
          and other ways to set authorization policies.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The default value of the
            <literal>AuthBasicProvider</literal> option is
            <literal>file</literal>, so we won't bother including
            it in future examples.  Just know that if in a broader
            context you've set this value to something else, you'll
            need to explicitly reset it to <literal>file</literal>
            within your Subversion <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal>
            block in order to get that behavior.</para>

        <title>Digest authentication</title>

        <para>Digest authentication is an improvement on Basic
          authentication which allows the server to verify a client's
          identity without sending the password over the network
          unprotected.  Both client and server create a non-reversible
          MD5 hash of the username, password, requested URI, and a
          <firstterm>nonce</firstterm> (number used once) provided by
          the server and changed each time authentication is required.
          The client sends its hash to the server, and the server then
          verifies that the hashes match.</para>

        <para>Configuring Apache to use Digest authentication is
          straightforward.  You'll need to ensure that
          the <literal>mod_auth_digest</literal> module is available
          (instead of <literal>mod_auth_basic</literal>), and then
          make a few small variations on our prior example:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Digest
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Digest
  AuthDigestProvider file
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htdigest

  # Authorization: Authenticated users only
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Notice that <literal>AuthType</literal> is now set to
          <literal>Digest</literal>, and we specify a different path
          for <literal>AuthUserFile</literal>.  Digest authentication
          uses a different file format than Basic authentication, 
          created and managed using Apache's <command>htdigest</command>
          utility<footnote><para>See
          <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htdigest.html"
          />.</para></footnote> rather than <command>htpasswd</command>.
          Digest authentication also has the additional concept of a
          <quote>realm</quote>, which must match the value of the
          <literal>AuthName</literal> directive.</para>

        <note>
          <para>For digest authentication, the authentication provider
            is selected using the <literal>AuthDigestProvider</literal>
            as shown in the previous example.  As was the case with
            the <literal>AuthBasicProvider</literal> directive,
            <literal>file</literal> is the default value of the
            <literal>AuthDigestProvider</literal> option, so this
            line is not strictly required unless you need to override
            a different value thereof inherited from a broader
            configuration context.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The password file can be created as follows:</para>

      <para>At this point, you've configured authentication, but not
        authorization.  Apache is able to challenge clients and
        confirm identities, but it has not been told how to allow or
        restrict access to the clients bearing those identities.  This
        section describes two strategies for controlling access to
        your repositories.</para>

        <para>The simplest form of access control is to authorize
          certain users for either read-only access to a repository or
          read/write access to a repository.</para>

        <para>You can restrict access on all repository operations by
          adding <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directly inside
          the <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block.  The example
          from <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn.digest"/>
          allows only clients that successfully authenticate to do
          anything with the Subversion repository:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn

</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Sometimes you don't need to run such a tight ship.  For
          example, the server hosting Subversion's own source code at
          <ulink url="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/"/> allows
          anyone in the world to perform read-only repository tasks (such as
          checking out working copies and browsing the repository),
          but restricts write operations to authenticated users.  The
          <literal>Limit</literal> and <literal>LimitExcept</literal>
          directives allow for this type of selective restriction.
          Like the <literal>Location</literal> directive, these blocks
          have starting and ending tags, and you would nest them
          inside your <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal>
          block.</para>

        <para>The parameters present on the <literal>Limit</literal>
          and <literal>LimitExcept</literal> directives are HTTP
          request types that are affected by that block.  For example,
          to allow anonymous read-only operations, you would use the
          <literal>LimitExcept</literal> directive (passing the
          <literal>GET</literal>, <literal>PROPFIND</literal>,
          <literal>OPTIONS</literal>, and <literal>REPORT</literal>
          request type parameters) and place the previously mentioned
          <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directive inside the
          <literal>&lt;LimitExcept&gt;</literal> block instead of just
          inside the <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block.</para>

          <literal>Security</literal> section of the Apache

        <para>It's possible to set up finer-grained permissions using
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command>.  This Apache module grabs
          the various opaque URLs passing from client to server, asks
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to decode them, and then
          possibly vetoes requests based on access policies defined in
          a configuration file.</para>

        <para>If you've built Subversion from source code,
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> is automatically built
          and installed alongside <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.
          Many binary distributions install it automatically as well.
          To verify that it's installed correctly, make sure it comes
          right after <command>mod_dav_svn</command>'s
          <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive in
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename>:</para>

LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>To activate this module, you need to configure your
          <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block to use the
          <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> directive which specifies
          a single file containing the permissions policy for paths within
          your repositories.  Beginning with Subversion 1.7, you can
          also use <literal>AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile</literal>
          directive to specify a per repository access file.
          (In a moment, we'll discuss the format of that file.)</para>

        <para>Apache is flexible, so you have the option to configure
          your block in one of three general patterns.  To begin,
          choose one of these basic configuration patterns.  (The
          following examples are very simple; look at Apache's own
          documentation for much more detail on Apache authentication
          and authorization options.)</para>

        <para>The most open approach is to allow access to everyone.
          This means Apache never sends authentication challenges, and
          all users are treated as <quote>anonymous</quote>.  (See
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1"
          />.)</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1">
          <title>A sample configuration for anonymous access</title>
          <programlisting>

  # Authentication: None

  # Authorization: Path-based access control
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>On the opposite end of the paranoia scale, you can
          configure Apache to authenticate all clients.
          This block unconditionally requires authentication via the
          <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directive, and defines
          a means to authenticate valid users.  (See
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2"/>.)</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2">

  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>A third very popular pattern is to allow a combination
          of authenticated and anonymous access.  For example, many
          administrators want to allow anonymous users to read certain
          repository directories, but restrict access to more
          sensitive areas to authenticated users.  In this setup, all
          users start out accessing the repository anonymously.  If
          your access control policy demands a real username at any
          point, Apache will demand authentication from the client.
          To do this, use both the <literal>Satisfy Any</literal>
          and <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directives.  (See
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3"
          />.)</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3">

&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>The next step is to create the authorization file
          containing access rules for particular paths within the
          repository.  We describe how later in this chapter, in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz"/>.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff">
        <title>Disabling path-based checks</title>

        <para>The <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module goes through a
          lot of work to make sure that data you've marked
          <quote>unreadable</quote> doesn't get accidentally leaked.
          This means it needs to closely monitor all of the paths
          and file-contents returned by commands such as <command>svn
          checkout</command> and <command>svn update</command>.
          If these commands encounter a path that isn't
          readable according to some authorization policy, the
          path is typically omitted altogether.  In the case of
          history or rename tracing&mdash;for example, running a command such
          as <userinput>svn cat -r OLD foo.c</userinput> on a file that
          was renamed long ago&mdash;the rename tracking will simply
          halt if one of the object's former names is determined to be
          read-restricted.</para>

        <para>All of this path checking can sometimes be quite
          expensive, especially in the case of <command>svn
          log</command>.  When retrieving a list of revisions, the
          server looks at every changed path in each revision and
          checks it for readability.  If an unreadable path is
          discovered, it's omitted from the list of the revision's
          changed paths (normally seen with
          the <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>) option),
          and the whole log message is suppressed.  Needless to say,
          this can be time-consuming on revisions that affect a large
          number of files.  This is the cost of security: even if you
          haven't configured a module such as
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> at all, the
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module is still asking Apache
          <command>httpd</command> to run authorization checks on
          every path.  The <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module has
          no idea what authorization modules have been installed, so
          all it can do is ask Apache to invoke whatever might be
          present.</para>

        <para>On the other hand, there's also an escape hatch of
          sorts, which allows you to trade security features for
          speed.  If you're not enforcing any sort of per-directory
          authorization (i.e., not using

          <para>If the client receives a challenge for a certificate,

        results out of your Subversion service offering.  In this

        sake may affect your other services.</para>

        <title>KeepAlive</title>

        <para>By default, the Apache HTTP Server is configured to
          enable the re-use of a single server connection for multiple
          requests.  That's very beneficial for Subversion, because
          unlike many HTTP-based applications, Subversion can very
          quickly generate hundreds or thousands of requests against
          the server for a single operation, and the cost of opening a
          new connection to the server is non-trivial.  Subversion
          wants to squeeze as many requests as possible out of a
          single connection before that connection is terminated by
          the server.  The <literal>KeepAlive</literal> directive is the
          boolean flag which enables or disables this connection
          re-use facility, and as we indicated previously, by default
          its value is <literal>On</literal>.</para>

        <para>But there's another directive which limits the number of
          requests a client is allowed to submit on a single
          connection:  the <literal>MaxKeepAliveRequests</literal>
          directive.  The default value for that option
          is <literal>100</literal>.  This was probably sufficient for
          older versions of Subversion, but Subversion 1.8 employs a
          different HTTP communications library (called Serf) which
          prefers to pipeline several smaller requests for specific bits
          of information rather than asking the server to transmit
          huge chunks of data in a single response.  We recommend that
          you increase the value of the
          <literal>MaxKeepAliveRequests</literal> option
          to at least <literal>1000</literal>.</para>

        <title>Bulk updates</title>

        <para>The biggest difference between the way that Subversion
          1.8 clients and pre-1.8 clients behave is in how update-style
          operations (<command>svn checkout</command>, <command>svn
          update</command>, <command>svn switch</command>, etc.) are
          handled.  Older clients which used the Neon HTTP library for
          communications preferred to ask the server for the entire
          payload of information required from the server in a single
          request.  Admins will have noticed that in their server
          logs, there would be some initial handshaking operations,
          and then a <literal>REPORT</literal> request with a massive
          response.  That response was the entire checkout/update
          dataset!</para>

        <para>Subversion clients which use the Serf HTTP
          library&mdash;which includes all clients built atop the
          Subversion 1.8&mdash;still send the <literal>REPORT</literal>
          request, but with slightly different flags set inside that
          request.  These flags ask the server not to send all the
          data for the operation, but to instead send only a checklist
          of other more specific things that the client needs to
          subsequently fetch from the server in order to complete that
          operation.  In the server's <filename>access_log</filename>,
          that <literal>REPORT</literal> is followed by many smaller
          requests (<literal>GET</literal>s and, in older versions of
          Subversion, <literal>PROPFIND</literal>s).</para>

        <para>There are pros and cons to each approach.  As we've
          mentioned, the so-called bulk updates generate considerably
          less information in the server logs, but a given Apache HTTP
          Server child process is completely consumed for the duration
          of what could be a lengthy operation.  Non-bulk updates
          offer opportunities for setting up content caches (which
          themselves can improve performance), but generate server log
          traffic which is whole orders of magnitude larger than the
          bulk update approach.  So, for one reason or another,
          administrators may desire to exert a little more control
          over which approach the clients use.  Subversion 1.6
          introduced the <literal>SVNAllowBulkUpdates</literal>
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> directive&mdash;a simple
          boolean flag&mdash;to allow admins to specify whether the
          server was allowed to honor bulk update requests.  In
          Subversion 1.8, this directive has expanded to include
          a <literal>Prefer</literal> value in addition to the
          <literal>On</literal> and <literal>Off</literal> values it
          already supported. When <literal>SVNAllowBulkUpdates</literal>
          is set to <literal>Prefer</literal>, supporting clients (1.8
          or newer) will try to use the bulk update approach unless
          otherwise configured.</para>

        <para>One of the most useful benefits of an Apache/WebDAV
          configuration for your Subversion repository is that your
          versioned files and directories are immediately available
          for viewing via a regular web browser.  Since Subversion
          uses URLs to identify versioned resources, those URLs used
          for HTTP-based repository access can be typed directly into
          a web browser.  Your browser will issue an
          HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request for that URL; based on
          whether that URL represents a versioned directory or
          file, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> will respond with a
          directory listing or with file contents.</para>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.syntax">
          <title>URL syntax</title>

          <para>If the URLs do not contain any information about which
            version of the resource you wish to
            see, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> will answer with the
            youngest version.  This functionality has the wonderful
            side effect that you can pass around Subversion URLs to
            your peers as references to documents, and those URLs will
            always point at the latest manifestation of that document.
            Of course, you can even use the URLs as hyperlinks from
            other web sites, too.</para>

          <para>As of Subversion 1.6, <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
            supports a public URI syntax for examining older revisions
            of both files and directories.  The syntax uses the query
            string portion of the URL to specify either or both of a
            peg revision and operative revision, which Subversion will
            then use to determine which version of the file or
            directory to display to your web browser.  Add the query
            string name/value pair
            <literal>p=<replaceable>PEGREV</replaceable></literal>,
            where <replaceable>PEGREV</replaceable> is a revision
            number, to specify the peg revision you wish to apply to the
            request.  Use
            <literal>r=<replaceable>REV</replaceable></literal>,
            where <replaceable>REV</replaceable> is a revision number, to
            specify an operative revision.</para>

          <para>What if the thing you're trying to view no longer exists
            in the youngest revision of the repository?  That's where a
            peg revision is handy:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/deleted-thing.txt?p=321
</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>And of course, you can combine peg revision and
            operative revision specifiers to fine-tune the exact item
            you wish to view:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/renamed-thing.txt?p=123&amp;r=21
</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>The previous URL would display revision 21 of the
            object which, in revision 123, was located
            at <filename>/trunk/renamed-thing.txt</filename> in the
            repository.  See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.pegrevs" /> for a
            detailed explanation of these <quote>peg revision</quote>
            and <quote>operative revision</quote> concepts.  They can
            be a bit tricky to wrap your head around.</para>

          <para>Beginning with Subversion 1.8, <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
            has the ability to substitute keywords.  When 
            <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
            finds the query argument <literal>kw=1</literal> added to
            the URL of a file, it will expand keywords when delivering
            the file's content.  Omitting the <literal>kw</literal>
            parameter or using any value besides <literal>1</literal>
            for that parameter will cause Subversion to use its
            default behavior, which is to deliver the file's content
            without any keywords expanded.</para>

          <para>Because keyword substitution is typically performed by the
            Subversion client as part of its working copy administration
            and management, this is a handy way to get the server to deliver
            a keyword-expanded form of your versioned file without the use
            of a working copy.</para>

          <para>For example, if you wish to see the latest version of a
            <filename>README.txt</filename> file located in your
            project's <filename>/trunk</filename> with keywords
            expanded, add the query argument <literal>kw=1</literal> to the
            URL:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/README.txt?kw=1
</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>As with client-side keyword expansion, only those keywords
            which are explicitly designated for expansion via the
            <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property set on the file itself
            will be expanded.  See
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.keywords" /> for a
            detailed description of the keyword substitution feature.</para>

          <para>As a reminder, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> offers only a
            limited repository browsing experience.  You can see directory
            listings and file contents, but no revision properties
            (such as commit log messages) or file/directory
            properties.  For folks who require more extensive browsing
            of repositories and their history, there are several
            third-party software packages which offer this.  Some
            examples include ViewVC (<ulink url="http://viewvc.org" />),
            Trac (<ulink url="http://trac.edgewall.org" />) and WebSVN
            (<ulink url="http://websvn.info" />).  These third-party
            tools don't affect <command>mod_dav_svn</command>'s
            built-in <quote>browseability</quote>, and generally offer
            a much wider set of features, including the display of the
            aforementioned property sets, display of content
            differences between file revisions, and so on.</para>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.mimetype">
          <title>Proper MIME type</title>

          <para>When browsing a Subversion repository, the web browser
            gets a clue about how to render a file's contents by
            looking at the <literal>Content-Type:</literal> header
            returned in Apache's response to the
            HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request.  The value of this
            header is some sort of MIME type.  By default, Apache will
            tell the web browsers that all repository files are of
            the <quote>default</quote> MIME type,
            typically <literal>text/plain</literal>.  This can be
            frustrating, however, if a user wishes repository files to
            render as something more meaningful&mdash;for example,
            it might be nice to have a <filename>foo.html</filename> file
            in the repository actually render as HTML when
            browsing.</para>

          <para>To make this happen, you need only to make sure that
            your files have the proper <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
            set.  We discuss this in more detail in
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/>,
            and you can even configure your client to automatically
            attach proper <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> properties
            to files entering the repository for the first time; see
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.auto"/>.</para>

          <para>Continuing our example, if one were to set
            the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property
            to <literal>text/html</literal> on
            file <filename>foo.html</filename>, Apache would properly
            tell your web browser to render the file as HTML.  One
            could also attach proper <literal>image/*</literal>
            MIME-type properties to image files and ultimately get an
            entire web site to be viewable directly from a repository!
            There's generally no problem with this, as long as the web
            site doesn't contain any dynamically generated
            content.</para>

          <title>Customizing the look</title>

          <para>You generally will get more use out of URLs to
            versioned files&mdash;after all, that's where the
            interesting content tends to lie.  But you might have
            occasion to browse a Subversion directory listing, where
            you'll quickly note that the generated HTML used to
            display that listing is very basic, and certainly not
            intended to be aesthetically pleasing (or even
            interesting).  To enable customization of these directory
            displays, Subversion provides an XML index feature.  A
            single <literal>SVNIndexXSLT</literal> directive in your
            repository's <literal>Location</literal> block of
            <filename>httpd.conf</filename> will
            instruct <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to generate XML
            output when displaying a directory listing, and to
            reference the XSLT stylesheet of your choice:</para>

          <para>Using the <literal>SVNIndexXSLT</literal> directive
            and a creative XSLT stylesheet, you can make your
            directory listings match the color schemes and imagery
            used in other parts of your web site.  Or, if you'd
            prefer, you can use the sample stylesheets provided in the
            Subversion source distribution's
            <filename>tools/xslt/</filename> directory.
            Keep in mind that the path provided to the
            <literal>SVNIndexXSLT</literal> directory is actually a

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.logging">
        <title>Apache logging</title>

        <para>Because Apache is an HTTP server at heart, it contains
          fantastically flexible logging features.  It's beyond the
          scope of this book to discuss all of the ways logging can be
          configured, but we should point out that even the most
          generic <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file will cause
          Apache to produce two logs:
          <filename>error_log</filename>
          and <filename>access_log</filename>.  These logs may appear
          in different places, but are typically created in the
          logging area of your Apache installation.  (On Unix, they
          often live
          in <filename>/usr/local/apache2/logs/</filename>.)</para>

        <para>The <filename>error_log</filename> describes any internal
          errors that Apache runs into as it works.
          The <filename>access_log</filename> file records every
          incoming HTTP request received by Apache.  This makes it
          easy to see, for example, which IP addresses Subversion
          clients are coming from, how often particular clients use
          the server, which users are authenticating properly, and
          which requests succeed or fail.</para>

        <para>Unfortunately, because HTTP is a stateless protocol,
          even the simplest Subversion client operation generates
          multiple network requests.  It's very difficult to look at
          the <filename>access_log</filename> and deduce what the
          client was doing&mdash;most operations look like a series
          of cryptic <literal>PROPPATCH</literal>, <literal>GET</literal>,
          <literal>PUT</literal>, and <literal>REPORT</literal>
          requests.  To make things worse, many client operations send
          nearly identical series of requests, so it's even harder to
          tell them apart.</para>

        <para><command>mod_dav_svn</command>, however, can come to
          your aid.  By activating an <quote>operational
          logging</quote> feature, you can
          ask <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to create a separate log
          file describing what sort of high-level operations your
          clients are performing.</para>

        <para>To do this, you need to make use of
          Apache's <literal>CustomLog</literal> directive (which is
          explained in more detail in Apache's own documentation).
          Be sure to invoke this
          directive <emphasis>outside</emphasis> your
          Subversion <literal>Location</literal> block:</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  &hellip;
&lt;/Location&gt;

CustomLog logs/svn_logfile "%t %u %{SVN-ACTION}e" env=SVN-ACTION
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>In this example, we're asking Apache to create a special
          logfile, <filename>svn_logfile</filename>, in the standard
          Apache <filename>logs</filename> directory.
          The <literal>%t</literal> and <literal>%u</literal>
          variables are replaced by the time and username of the
          request, respectively.  The really important parts are the
          two instances of <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal>.
          When Apache sees that variable, it substitutes the value of
          the <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal> environment variable,
          which is automatically set by <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
          whenever it detects a high-level client action.</para>

        <para>So, instead of having to interpret a
          traditional <filename>access_log</filename> like
          this:</para>

        <informalexample>

</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>you can peruse a much more

        </informalexample>

        <para>In addition to the <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal>
          environment variable, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> also
          populates the <literal>SVN-REPOS</literal>
          and <literal>SVN-REPOS-NAME</literal> variables, which carry
          the filesystem path to the repository and the basename
          thereof, respectively.  You might wish to include references
          to one or both of these variables in
          your <literal>CustomLog</literal> format string, too,
          especially if you are combining usage information from
          multiple repositories into a single log file.  For an
          exhaustive list of all actions logged, see
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.operational-logging"/>.</para>

        <para>Obviously, the more information that Apache logs about
          your Subversion activities, the more disk space on your
          server those logs consume.  It is non uncommon for
          high-traffic Subversion servers to generate many gigabytes
          of log information daily.  Obviously, logs are only valuable
          if they can be meaningfully processed, and huge log files
          can quickly become unwieldy.  There are various standard
          approaches to Apache HTTP Server log management which are
          outside the scope of this book.  Administrators are
          encouraged to use the log rotation and archival approach
          which works best for them.</para>

        <para>But what if Subversion is simply generating too much log
          information to be useful?  For example, in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.perf.bulk-updates" />,
          we mentioned that certain approaches that Subversion clients
          may take to checkouts and other update-style operations can
          cause rapid growth of your server logs as requests for
          individual pieces of the update data set are individually
          logged (whereas in previous version of Subversion, they
          might not have been).  In this case, you might consider
          using some Apache configuration magic to selectively silence
          some of that log activity.</para>

        <para>Apache HTTP Server's
          <literal>mod_setenvif</literal> module offers
          a <literal>SetEnvIf</literal> directive which is handy for
          conditionally setting environment variables.  And as it
          turns out, the <literal>CustomLog</literal> directive can be
          told to conditionally log requests based on the state of
          environment variables.  The following is a sample
          configuration which instructs the server
          to <emphasis>not</emphasis> log <literal>GET</literal>
          and <literal>PROPFIND</literal> requests aimed at private
          Subversion URLs.</para>

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
# Matches everything, just to initialize the "in_repos" variable.
SetEnvIf Request_URI "^" in_repos=0

# Set "in_repos" if this is a request for a private Subversion URL.
SetEnvIf Request_URI "/!svn/" in_repos=1

# Set "do_not_log" for non-public request types we don't care to log.
SetEnvIf Request_Method "GET" do_not_log
SetEnvIf Request_Method "PROPFIND" do_not_log

# Unset "do_not_log" for URLs that aren't private Subversion URLs.
SetEnvIf in_repos 0 !do_not_log

# Log requests, but only if "do_not_log" isn't set.
CustomLog logs/access_log env=!do_not_log
</programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        <para>Using this configuration, <command>httpd</command> would
          still log <literal>GET</literal> requests aimed at public
          Subversion URLs.  These are the sorts of requests generated
          by a web browser as someone navigates the repository
          directly.  But <literal>GET</literal>
          and <literal>PROPFIND</literal> requests aimed at so-called
          "private" Subversion URLs&mdash;which are the very sorts of
          requests used to fetch each and every individual file during
          a checkout operation&mdash;won't get logged.</para>

          </indexterm>One of the nice advantages of using Apache as a
          Subversion server is that it can be set up for simple
          replication.  For example, suppose that your team is
          distributed across four offices around the globe.  The
          Subversion repository can exist only in one of those
          offices, which means the other three offices will not enjoy
          accessing it&mdash;they're likely to experience
          significantly slower traffic and response times when
          updating and committing code.  A powerful solution is to set
          up a system consisting of one <firstterm>master</firstterm>
          Apache server and several <firstterm>slave</firstterm>
          Apache servers.  If you place a slave server in each office,
          users can check out a working copy from whichever slave
          is closest to them.  All read requests go to their local
          slave.  Write requests get automatically routed to the
          single master server.  When the commit completes, the master
          then automatically <quote>pushes</quote> the new revision to
          each slave server using the <command>svnsync</command>
          replication tool.</para>

        <para>This configuration creates a huge perceptual speed
          increase for your users, because Subversion client traffic
          is typically 80&ndash;90% read requests.  And if those
          requests are coming from a <emphasis>local</emphasis>
          server, it's a huge win.</para>

        <para>In this section, we'll walk you through a standard setup
          of this single-master/multiple-slave system.  However, keep
          in mind that your servers must be running at least Apache
          2.2.0 (with <command>mod_proxy</command> loaded) and
          Subversion 1.5 (<command>mod_dav_svn</command>).</para>

        <note>
          <para>Ours is just one example of how you might setup a
            Subversion write-through proxy configuration.  There are
            other approaches.  For example, rather than having the
            master server push changes out to every slave server, the
            slaves could periodically pull those changes from the
            master.  Or perhaps the master could push changes to a
            single slave, which then pushes the same change to the
            next slave, and so on down the line.  Administrators are
            encouraged to use this section for basic understanding
            of what happens in a Subversion WebDAV proxy deployment
            scenario, and then implement the specific approach that
            works best for their organization.</para>
        </note>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.writethruproxy.configure">
          <title>Configure the servers</title>

          <para>First, configure your master server's
            <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file in the usual way.
            Make the repository available at a certain URI location,
            and configure authentication and authorization however
            you'd like.  After that's done, configure each of your
            <quote>slave</quote> servers in the exact same way, but
            add the special <literal>SVNMasterURI</literal> directive
            to the block:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  SVNMasterURI http://master.example.com/svn
  &hellip;
&lt;/Location&gt;
</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>This new directive tells a slave server to redirect
            all write requests to the master.  (This is done
            automatically via Apache's <command>mod_proxy</command>
            module.)  Ordinary read requests, however, are still
            serviced by the slaves.  Be sure that your master and
            slave servers all have matching authentication and
            authorization configurations;  if they fall out of sync,
            it can lead to big headaches.</para>

          <para>Next, we need to deal with the problem of infinite
            recursion.  With the current configuration, imagine what
            will happen when a Subversion client performs a commit to
            the master server.  After the commit completes, the server
            uses <command>svnsync</command> to replicate the new
            revision to each slave.  But because
            <command>svnsync</command> appears to be just another
            Subversion client performing a commit, the slave will
            immediately attempt to proxy the incoming write request
            back to the master!  Hilarity ensues.</para>

          <para>The solution to this problem is to have the master
            push revisions to a different
            <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> on the slaves.  This
            location is configured to <emphasis>not</emphasis> proxy
            write requests at all, but to accept normal commits from
            (and only from) the master's IP address:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
&lt;Location /svn-proxy-sync&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
  # Only let the server's IP address access this Location:
  Allow from 10.20.30.40
  &hellip;
&lt;/Location&gt;

          <para>Now that you've configured
            your <literal>Location</literal> blocks on master and
            slaves, you need to configure the master to replicate to
            the slaves.  Our walkthough uses <command>svnsync</command>,
            which is covered in more detail in

          <para>First, make sure that each slave repository has a
            <filename>pre-revprop-change</filename> hook script which
            allows remote revision property changes.  (This is
            standard procedure for being on the receiving end of
            <command>svnsync</command>.) Then log into the master
            server and configure each of the slave repository URIs to
            receive data from the master repository on the local
            disk:</para>

          <para>The only thing we've left out here is what to do about
            user-level locks (of the <command>svn lock</command>
            variety).  Locks are enforced by the master server during
            commit operations; but all the information about locks is
            distributed during read operations such as <command>svn
            update</command> and <command>svn status</command> by the
            slave server.  As such, a fully functioning proxy setup
            needs to perfectly replicate lock information from the
            master server to the slave servers.  Unfortunately, most
            of the mechanisms that one might employ to accomplish this
            replication fall short in one way or
            another<footnote><para><ulink
            url="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3457"
            /> tracks these problems.</para></footnote>.  Many teams
            don't use Subversion's locking features at all, so this
            may be a nonissue for you.  Sadly, for those teams which
            do use locks, we have no recommendations on how to
            gracefully work around this shortcoming.</para>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.writethruproxy.caveats">
          <title>Caveats</title>

          <para>Your master/slave replication system should now be
            ready to use.  A couple of words of warning are in order,
            however.  Remember that this replication isn't entirely
            robust in the face of computer or network crashes.  For
            example, if one of the automated
            <command>svnsync</command> commands fails to complete for
            some reason, the slaves will begin to fall behind.  For
            example, your remote users will see that they've committed
            revision 100, but then when they run <command>svn
            update</command>, their local server will tell them that
            revision 100 doesn't yet exist!  Of course, the problem
            will be automatically fixed the next time another commit
            happens and the subsequent <command>svnsync</command> is
            successful&mdash;the sync will replicate all waiting
            revisions.  But still, you may want to set up some sort of
            out-of-band monitoring to notice synchronization failures
            and force <command>svnsync</command> to run when things go
            wrong.</para>

          <para>Another limitation of the write-through proxy
            deployment model involves version mismatches&mdash;of the
            version of Subversion which is installed, that
            is&mdash;between the master and slave servers.  Each new
            release of Subversion may (and often does) add new
            features to the network protocol used between the clients
            and servers.  Since feature negotiation happens against
            the slave, it is the slave's protocol version and feature
            set which is used.  But write operations are passed
            through to the master server quite literally.  Therefore,
            there is a risk that the slave server will answer a
            feature negotiation request from the client in way that is
            true for the slave, but untrue for the master if the
            master is running an older version of Subversion.  This
            could result in the client trying to use a new feature
            that the master doesn't understand, and failing.</para>

          <para>Subversion 1.8 helps to mitigate this problem via the
            introduction of a new Apache configuration
            directive, <literal>SVNMasterVersion</literal>.  By
            configuring each of your slave servers
            with <literal>SVNMasterVersion</literal> set to the
            release version of the Subversion instance which is
            running on your master server, the slave servers can more
            accurately negotiate feature support with the
            client.</para>

          <para>Unfortunately, Subversion 1.7 doesn't offer
            the <literal>SVNMasterVersion</literal> configuration
            directive and is known to have some specific problems
            along these lines.  If you are deploying a Subversion 1.7
            slave server in front of a pre-1.7 master, you'll want to
            configure your slave server's
            Subversion <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block with
            the <literal>SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol Off</literal>
            directive.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>For the best results possible, try to run the same
              version of Subversion on your master and slave
              servers.</para>
          </tip>

          <sidebar>
            <title>Can We Set Up Replication with svnserve?</title>

            <para>If you're using <command>svnserve</command> instead
              of Apache as your server, you can certainly configure
              your repository's hook scripts to invoke
              <command>svnsync</command> as we've shown here, thereby
              causing automatic replication from master to slaves.
              Unfortunately, at the time of this writing there is no way to
              make slave <command>svnserve</command> servers
              automatically proxy write requests back to the master
              server.  This means your users would only be able to
              check out read-only working copies from the slave
              servers.  You'd have to configure your slave servers to
              disallow write access completely.  This might be useful
              for creating read-only <quote>mirrors</quote> of popular
              open source projects, but it's not a transparent
              proxying system.</para>

        <title>Other Apache features</title>

        <para>Several of the features already provided by Apache in
          its role as a robust web server can be leveraged for
          increased functionality or security in Subversion as well.
          The Subversion client is able to use SSL (the Secure Sockets
          Layer, discussed earlier).  If your Subversion client is
          built to support SSL, it can access your Apache server
          using <literal>https://</literal> and enjoy a high-quality
          encrypted network session.</para>

        <para>Equally useful are other features of the Apache and
          Subversion relationship, such as the ability to specify a
          custom port (instead of the default HTTP port 80) or a
          virtual domain name by which the Subversion repository
          should be accessed, or the ability to access the repository
          through an HTTP proxy.</para>

        <para>Finally, because <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is
          speaking a subset of the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, it's
          possible to access the repository via third-party DAV
          clients.  Most modern operating systems (Win32, OS X, and
          Linux) have the built-in ability to mount a DAV server as a
          standard network <quote>shared folder.</quote> This is a
          complicated topic, but also wondrous when implemented.  For
          details, read <xref linkend="svn.webdav"/>.</para>

        <para>Note that there are a number of other small tweaks one

                by default), choosing instead to enjoy the performance
                benefits that the new protocol offers.  However, whena
                configuring a server as a write-through proxy to
                another server which does not support the new
                protocol, set this directive's value

                responses to update-style <literal>REPORT</literal>
                requests.  Subversion clients use
                <literal>REPORT</literal> requests to get information
                about directory tree checkouts and updates from
                <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.  They can ask the
                server to send that information in one of two ways:
                with the entirety of the tree's information in one
                massive response, or with a
                <firstterm>skelta</firstterm> (a skeletal
                representation of a tree delta) which contains just
                enough information for the client to know what
                <emphasis>additional</emphasis> data to request from
                the server.  When this directive is included with a

                files and directories needed for updates and
                checkouts, thus leaving an audit trail of

    <title>Path-Based Authorization</title>

    <para>Both Apache and <command>svnserve</command> are capable of
      granting (or denying) permissions to users.  Typically this is
      done over the entire repository: a user can read the repository
      (or not), and she can write to the repository (or not).</para>

    <para>It's also possible, however, to define finer-grained access
      rules.  One set of users may have permission to write to a
      certain directory in the repository, but not others; another
      directory might not even be readable by all but a few special
      people.  It's even possible to restrict access on a per file
      basis.</para>

    <para>Both Subversion servers use a common file format to describe
      these path-based access rules.  In this section, we will
      explain that file format, as well how to configure your
      Subversion server to use it for managing path-based
      authorization.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Do You Really Need Path-Based Access Control?</title>

      <para>A lot of administrators setting up Subversion for the
        first time tend to jump into path-based access control without
        giving it a lot of thought.  The administrator usually knows
        which teams of people are working on which projects, so it's
        easy to jump in and grant certain teams access to certain
        directories and not others.  It seems like a natural thing,
        and it appeases the administrator's desire to maintain tight
        control of the repository.</para>

      <para>Note, though, that there are often invisible (and
        visible!) costs associated with this feature.  In the visible
        category, the server needs to do a lot more work to ensure
        that the user has the right to read or write each specific
        path; in certain situations, there's very noticeable
        performance loss.  In the invisible category, consider the
        culture you're creating.  Most of the time, while certain
        users <emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> be committing changes to
        certain parts of the repository, that social contract doesn't
        need to be technologically enforced.  Teams can sometimes
        spontaneously collaborate with each other; someone may want to
        help someone else out by committing to an area she doesn't
        normally work on.  By preventing this sort of thing at the
        server level, you're setting up barriers to unexpected
        collaboration.  You're also creating a bunch of rules that
        need to be maintained as projects develop, new users are
        added, and so on.  It's a bunch of extra work to
        maintain.</para>

        <para>Remember that this is a version control system!  Even if
        somebody accidentally commits a change to something she
        shouldn't, it's easy to undo the change.  And if a user
        commits to the wrong place with deliberate malice, it's a
        social problem anyway, and that the problem needs to be dealt
        with outside Subversion.</para>

      <para>So, before you begin restricting users' access rights, ask
        yourself whether there's a real, honest need for this, or
        whether it's just something that <quote>sounds good</quote> to
        an administrator.  Decide whether it's worth sacrificing some
        server speed, and remember that there's very little risk
        involved; it's bad to become dependent on technology as a
        crutch for social problems.<footnote><para>A common theme in
        this book!</para></footnote></para>

      <para>As an example to ponder, consider that the Subversion
        project itself has always had a notion of who is allowed to
        commit where, but it's always been enforced socially.  This is
        a good model of community trust, especially for open source
        projects.  Of course, sometimes there <emphasis>are</emphasis>
        truly legitimate needs for path-based access control; within
        corporations, for example, certain types of data really can be
        sensitive, and access needs to be genuinely restricted to
        small groups of people.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.getting-started">

      <title>Getting Started with Path-Based Access Control</title>

      <para>Subversion offers path-based access control in Apache via
        the <command>mod_authz_svn</command> module, which must be
        loaded using the <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive
        in <filename>httpd.conf</filename> in the same fashion
        that <command>mod_dav_svn</command> itself is loaded.  To
        enable the use of this module for your repositories, you'll
        add the <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> or
        <literal>AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile</literal> directives (again
        within the <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file) pointing to
        your own access rules file.  (For a full explanation, see
        <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir"/>.)</para>

      <para>To configure path-based authorization
        in <command>svnserve</command>, simply point
        the <literal>authz-db</literal> configuration variable (within
        your <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file) to your access
        rules file.</para>

      <para>Once your server knows where to look for your access
        rules, it's time to define those rules.</para>

      <para>The syntax of the Subversion access file is the same
        familiar one used by <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> and
        the runtime configuration files.  Lines that start with a hash
        (<literal>#</literal>) are ignored.  In its simplest form,
        each section names a versioned path and, optionally, the
        repository in which that path is found.  In other words,
        except for a few reserved sections, section names are of one
        of two forms: either <literal>[repos-name:path]</literal>
        or <literal>[path]</literal> when
        <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> is used.  If you configured
        per repository access files via <literal>AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile</literal>
        directive, you should always use <literal>[path]</literal> form
        only.  Authenticated usernames are the
        option names within each section, and an option's value
        describes that user's level of access to the repository path:
        either <literal>r</literal> (read-only) or <literal>rw</literal>
        (read/write).  If the user is not mentioned at all, no access is
        allowed.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Paths used in access file sections must be specified
          using Subversion's <quote>internal style</quote>, which
          mostly just means that they are encoded in UTF-8 and use
          forward slash (<literal>/</literal>) characters as directory
          separators (even on Windows systems).  Note also that these
          paths do not employ any character escaping mechanism (such
          as URI-encoding)&mdash;spaces in path names should be
          represented exactly as such in access file section names
          (<literal>[repos-name:path&nbsp;with&nbsp;spaces]</literal>,
          e.g.)</para>
      </note>

      <para>Here's a simple example demonstrating a piece of the
        access configuration which grants read access Sally, and
        read/write access to Harry, for the
        path <filename>/branches/calc/bug-142</filename> (and all its
        children) in the repository <literal>calc</literal>:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <warning>
        <para>Prior to version 1.7, Subversion treated repository names
          and paths in a case-insensitive fashion for the purposes of
          access control, converting them to lower case internally
          before comparing them against the contents of your access
          file.  It now does these comparisons case-sensitively.  If you
          upgraded to Subversion 1.7 from an older version, you should
          review your access files for case correctness.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The name of a repository as evaluated by the authorization
        subsystem is derived directly from the repository's path.
        Exactly how this happens differs between to two server
        options. <command>mod_dav_svn</command> uses only the basename
        of the repository's root URL<footnote><para>Any human-readable
        name for a repository configured via
        the <literal>SVNReposName</literal> <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
        directive will be ignored by the authorization subsystem.
        Your access control file sections must refer to repositories
        by their server-sensitive paths as previously
        described.</para></footnote>,
        while <command>svnserve</command> uses the entire relative
        path from the serving root (as determined by
        its <option>--root</option> (<option>-r</option>) command-line
        option) to the repository.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>The differences in the ways that a repository's name is
          determined by each of <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
          and <command>svnserve</command> can cause problems when
          trying to serve a repository via both servers
          simultaneously.  Naturally, an administrator would prefer to
          point both servers' configurations toward a common access
          file.  However, for this to work, you must ensure that the
          repository name portion of the file's section names are
          compatible with each server's idea of what the repository
          name should be&mdash;for example, by
          configuring <command>svnserve</command>'s root to be the
          same as <command>mod_dav_svn</command>'s configured
          <literal>SVNParentPath</literal>, or by using a different
          access file per repository so that section names needn't
          reference the repository at all.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>If you're using the <literal>SVNParentPath</literal>
        directive, it's important to specify the repository names in
        your sections.  If you omit them, a section such as
        <literal>[/some/dir]</literal> will match the path
        <filename>/some/dir</filename> in <emphasis>every</emphasis>
        repository.  If you're using the <literal>SVNPath</literal>
        directive, however, it's fine to provide only paths in your
        sections&mdash;after all, there's only one repository.</para>

      <para>Permissions are inherited from a path's parent directory.
        That means we can specify a subdirectory with a different
        access policy for Sally.  Let's continue our previous
        example, and grant Sally write access to a child of the branch
        that she's otherwise permitted only to read:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

# give sally write access only to the 'testing' subdir
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/testing]
sally = rw
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Now Sally can write to the <filename>testing</filename>
        subdirectory of the branch, but can still only read other parts.
        Harry, meanwhile, continues to have complete read/write access
        to the whole branch.</para>

      <para>It's also possible to explicitly deny permission to someone
        via inheritance rules, by setting the username variable to
        nothing:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]
harry =
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>In this example, Harry has read/write access to the
        entire <filename>bug-142</filename> tree, but has absolutely no
        access at all to the <filename>secret</filename> subdirectory
        within it.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>The thing to remember is that the most specific path
          always matches first.  The server tries to match the path
          itself, and then the parent of the path, then the parent of
          that, and so on.  The net effect is that mentioning a specific
          path in the access file will always override any permissions
          inherited from parent directories.</para>

        <para>Similarly, sections that specify a repository name have
          precedence over those that don't: if both
          <literal>[calc:/some/path]</literal> and
          <literal>[/some/path]</literal> are present, the former will be used
          and the latter ignored for <literal>calc</literal>.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>By default, nobody has any access to any repository at all.
        That means that if you're starting with an empty file, you'll
        probably want to give at least read permission to all users at
        the roots of the repositories.  You can do this by using the
        asterisk variable (<literal>*</literal>), which means <quote>all
        users</quote>:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[/]
* = r
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>This is a common setup; notice that no repository
        name is mentioned in the section name.  This makes all repositories
        world-readable to all users.  Once all users have read access to
        the repositories, you can give explicit
        <literal>rw</literal> permission to certain users on specific
        subdirectories within specific repositories.</para>

      <para>Note that while all of the previous examples use
        directories, that's only because defining access rules on
        directories is the most common case.  You may similarly
        restrict access on file paths, too.</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[calendar:/projects/calendar/manager.ics]
harry = rw
sally = r
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.groups">

      <title>Access Control Groups</title>

      <para>The access file also allows you to define whole groups of
        users, much like the Unix <filename>/etc/group</filename>
        file.  To do this, create a <literal>groups</literal> section
        in your access file, and then describe your groups within that
        section: each variable's name defines the name of the group,
        and its value is a comma-delimited list of usernames which
        are part of that group.</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = harry, sally, joe, frank, jane
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Groups can be granted access control just like users.
        Distinguish them with an <quote>at sign</quote>
        (<literal>@</literal>) prefix:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc-developers = rw

[paint:/projects/paint]
jane = r
@paint-developers = rw
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Another important fact is that group permissions are not
        overridden by individual user permissions. Rather, the
        <emphasis>combination</emphasis> of all matching permissions is
        granted.  In the prior example, Jane is a member of the
        <literal>paint-developers</literal> group, which has read/write
        access.  Combined with the <literal>jane = r</literal> rule,
        this still gives Jane read/write access.  Permissions for group
        members can only be extended beyond the permissions the group
        already has. Restricting users who are part of a group to less
        than their group's permissions is impossible.</para>

      <para>Groups can also be defined to contain other groups:</para>

      <informalexample>

    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.aliases">

      <title>Username Aliases</title>

      <para>Some authentication systems expect and carry relatively
        short usernames of the sorts we've been describing
        here&mdash;<literal>harry</literal>,
        <literal>sally</literal>, <literal>joe</literal>, and so on.  But
        other authentication systems&mdash;such as those which use LDAP
        stores or SSL client certificates&mdash;may carry much more
        complex usernames.  For example, Harry's username in an
        LDAP-protected system might be <literal>CN=Harold
        Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com</literal>.  With
        usernames like that, the access file can become quite bloated
        with long or obscure usernames that are easy to
        mistype.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, Subversion 1.5 introduced username aliases to
        the access file syntax.  Username aliases allow you to have to
        type the correct complex username only once, in a statement
        which assigns to it a more easily digestable alias.</para>

      <para>Username aliases are defined in the
        special <literal>aliases</literal> section of the access file,
        with each variable name in that section defining an alias, and
        the value of those variables carrying the real Subversion
        username which is being aliased.</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[aliases]
harry = CN=Harold Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
sally = CN=Sally Swatterbug,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
joe = CN=Gerald I. Joseph,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
&hellip;
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Once you've defined a set of aliases, you can refer to the
        users elsewhere in the access file via their aliases in all the
        same places you could have instead used their actual usernames.
        Simply prepend an ampersand to the alias to distinguish it from
        a regular username:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[groups]
calc-developers = &amp;harry, &amp;sally, &amp;joe
paint-developers = &amp;frank, &amp;sally, &amp;jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>You might also choose to use aliases if your users'
        usernames change frequently.  Doing so allows you to need to
        update only the aliases table when these username changes occur,
        instead of doing global search-and-replace operations on the
        whole access file.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.authclass-tokens">

      <title>Advanced Access Control Features</title>

      <para>Beginning with Subversion 1.5, the access file syntax also
        supports some <quote>magic</quote> tokens for helping you to
        make rule assignments based on the user's authentication
        class.  One such token is
        the <literal>$authenticated</literal> token.  Use this token
        where you would otherwise specify a username, alias, or group
        name in your authorization rules to declare the permissions
        granted to any user who has authenticated with any username at
        all.  Similarly employed is the <literal>$anonymous</literal>
        token, except that it matches everyone who has
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> authenticated with a username.</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
[calendar:/projects/calendar]
$anonymous = r

      <para>Another handy bit of access file syntax magic is the use
        of the tilde (<literal>~</literal>) character as an exclusion
        marker.  In your authorization rules, prefixing a username,
        alias, group name, or authentication class token with a tilde
        character will cause Subversion to apply the rule to users who
        do <emphasis>not</emphasis> match the rule.  Though somewhat
        unnecessarily obfuscated, the following block is equivalent to
        the one in the previous example:</para>

        certain users, you need to be aware of a possible nonoptimal
        behavior with <command>svn checkout</command>.</para>

      <para>Depending on which HTTP communication library the
        Subversion client is using, it may request that the entire
        payload of a checkout or update be delivered in a single
        (often large) response to the primary checkout/update request.
        When this happens, this single request is the
        <emphasis>only</emphasis> opportunity Apache has to demand
        user authentication.  This has some odd side effects.  For
        example, if a certain subdirectory of the repository is
        readable only by user Sally, and user Harry checks out a
        parent directory, his client will respond to the initial
        authentication challenge as Harry.  As the server generates
        the large response, there's no way it can resend an
        authentication challenge when it reaches the special
        subdirectory; thus the subdirectory is skipped altogether,
        rather than asking the user to reauthenticate as Sally at the
        right moment.</para>

      <para>In a similar way, if the root of the repository is
        anonymously world-readable, the entire checkout will be done
        without authentication&mdash;again, skipping the unreadable
        directory, rather than asking for authentication partway
        through.<footnote><para>For more on this, see the blog
        post <emphasis>Authz and Anon Authn Agony</emphasis> at

    <title>High-level Logging</title>

    <para>Both the Apache <command>httpd</command>
      and <command>svnserve</command> Subversion servers provide
      support for high-level logging of Subversion operations.
      Configuring each of the server options to provide this level of
      logging is done differently, of course, but the output from each
      is designed to conform to a uniform syntax.</para>

    <para>To enable high-level logging in <command>svnserve</command>,
      you need only use the <option>--log-file</option> command-line
      option when starting the server, passing as the value to the
      option the file to which <command>svnserve</command> should
      write its log output.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>
$ svnserve -d -r /path/to/repositories --log-file /var/log/svn.log
</screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Enabling the same in Apache is a bit more involved, but is
      essentially an extension of Apache's stock log output
      configuration mechanisms&mdash;see
      <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.logging"/> for
      details.</para>

    <para>The following is a list of Subversion action log messages

    <title>Server Optimization</title>

    <para>Part of the due diligence when offering a service such as a
      Subversion server involves capacity planning and performance
      tuning.  Subversion doesn't tend to be particularly greedy in
      terms of server resources such as CPU cycles and memory, but any
      service can benefit from optimizations, especially when usage of
      the service skyrockets<footnote><para>In Subversion's case, the
      skyrocketing affect is, of course, due to its cool name.  Well,
      that and its popularity, reliability, ease of
      use&hellip;.</para></footnote>.  In this section, we'll discuss
      some ways you can tweak your Subversion server configuration
      to offer even better performance and scalability.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.optimization.caching">
      <title>Data Caching</title>

      <para>Generally speaking, the most expensive part of a
        Subversion server's job is fetching data from the repository.
        Subversion 1.6 attempted to offset this cost by introducing
        some in-memory caching of certain classes of data read from
        the repository.  But Subversion 1.7 takes this a step further,
        not only caching the results of some of the more costly
        operations, but also by providing in each of the available
        servers the means by which fine-tune the size and some
        behaviors of the cache.</para>

      <para>For <command>svnserve</command>, you can specify the size
        of the cache using the <option>--memory-cache-size</option>
        (<option>-M</option>) command-line option.  You can also
        dictate whether <command>svnserve</command> should attempt to
        cache content fulltexts and deltas via the
        boolean <option>--cache-fulltexts</option>
        and <option>--cache-txdeltas</option> options,
        respectively.</para>

      <informalexample>
        <screen>
$ svnserve -d -r /path/to/repositories \
           --memory-cache-size 1024 \
           --cache-txdeltas yes \
           --cache-fulltexts yes
&hellip;
$
</screen>
      </informalexample>

      <para><command>mod_dav_svn</command> provides the same degree of
        cache configurability via <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
        directives.
        The <literal>SVNInMemoryCacheSize</literal>,
        <literal>SVNCacheFullTexts</literal>,
        and <literal>SVNCacheTextDeltas</literal> directives may be
        used at the server configuration level to control Subversion's
        data cache characteristics:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
&lt;IfModule dav_svn_module&gt;
  # Enable a 1 Gb Subversion data cache for both fulltext and deltas.
  SVNInMemoryCacheSize 1048576
  SVNCacheTextDeltas On
  SVNCacheFullTexts On
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>So what settings should you use?  Certainly you need to
        consider what resources are available on your server.  To get
        any benefit out of the cache at all, you'll probably want to
        let the cache be at least large enough to hold all the files
        which are most commonly accessed in your repository (for
        example, your project's <filename>trunk</filename> directory
        tree).</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Setting the memory cache size to <literal>0</literal>
          will disable this enhanced caching mechanism and cause
          Subversion to fall back to using the older cache mechanisms
          introduced in Subversion 1.6.</para>
      </tip>

      <note>
        <para>Currently, only repositories which make use of the FSFS
          backend data store make use of this data caching
          functionality.</para>
      </note>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.optimization.compression">
      <title>Network Compression of Data</title>

      <para>Compressing the data transmitted across the wire can
        greatly reduce the size of those network transmissions, but
        comes at the cost of server (and client) CPU cycles.
        Depending on your server's CPU capacity, the typical access
        patterns of the clients who use your servers, and the
        bandwidth of the networks between them, you might wish to fine
        tune just how hard your server will work to compress the data
        it sends across the wire.  To assist with this fine tuning
        process, Subversion 1.7 offers
        the <option>--compression</option> (<option>-c</option>)
        option to <command>svnserve</command> and
        the <literal>SVNCompressionLevel</literal> directive
        for <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.  Both accept a value which
        is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive), where 9 offers the
        best compression of wire data, and 0 disables compression
        altogether.</para>

      <para>For example, on a local area network (LAN) with 1-Gigabit
        connections, it might not make sense to have the server
        compress its network transmissions (which also forces the
        clients to decompress them), as the network itself is so fast
        that users won't really benefit from the smaller overall
        network payload.  On the other hand, servers which are
        accessed primarily by clients with low-bandwidth connections
        would be doing those clients a favor by minimizing the overall
        size of its network communications.</para>

    <title>Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods</title>

    <para>You've seen how a repository can be accessed in many
      different ways.  But is it possible&mdash;or safe&mdash;for your
      repository to be accessed by multiple methods simultaneously?
      The answer is yes, provided you use a bit of foresight.</para>

    <para>At any given time, these processes may require read and
      write access to your repository:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Regular system users using a Subversion client (as
          themselves) to access the repository directly via
          <literal>file://</literal> URLs</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Regular system users connecting to SSH-spawned private
          <command>svnserve</command> processes (running as
          themselves), which access the repository</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>An <command>svnserve</command> process&mdash;either a
          daemon or one launched by
          <command>inetd</command>&mdash;running as a particular fixed
          user</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>An Apache <command>httpd</command> process, running as a
          particular fixed user</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The most common problem administrators run into is
      repository ownership and permissions.  Does every process (or
      user) in the preceding list have the rights to read and write the
      repository's underlying data files?  Assuming you have a
      Unix-like operating system, a straightforward approach might be
      to place every potential repository user into a
      new <literal>svn</literal> group, and make the repository wholly
      owned by that group.  But even that's not enough, because a
      process may write to the database files using an unfriendly
      umask&mdash;one that prevents access by other users.</para>

    <para>So the next step beyond setting up a common group for
      repository users is to force every repository-accessing process
      to use a sane umask.  For users accessing the repository
      directly, you can make the <command>svn</command> program into a
      wrapper script that first runs <userinput>umask 002</userinput> and
      then runs the real <command>svn</command> client program.  You
      can write a similar wrapper script for the
      <command>svnserve</command> program, and add a <userinput>umask
      002</userinput> command to Apache's own startup script,
      <filename>apachectl</filename>.  For example:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <screen>
$ cat /usr/bin/svn

#!/bin/sh

umask 002
/usr/bin/svn-real "$@"
</screen>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Another common problem is often encountered on Unix-like
      systems.  If your repository is backed by Berkeley DB, for
      example, it occasionally creates new log files to journal its
      actions.  Even if the Berkeley DB repository is wholly owned by
      the <command>svn</command> group, these newly created log files
      won't necessarily be owned by that same group, which then
      creates more permissions problems for your users.  A good
      workaround is to set the group SUID bit on the
      repository's <filename>db</filename> directory.  This causes all
      newly created log files to have the same group owner as the
      parent directory.</para>

    <para>Once you've jumped through these hoops, your repository
      should be accessible by all the necessary processes.  It may
      seem a bit messy and complicated, but the problems of having
      multiple users sharing write access to common files are classic
      ones that are not often elegantly solved.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, most repository administrators will never
      <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have such a complex configuration.
      Users who wish to access repositories that live on the same
      machine are not limited to using <literal>file://</literal>
      access URLs&mdash;they can typically contact the Apache HTTP
      server or <command>svnserve</command> using
      <literal>localhost</literal> for the server name in their
      <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>svn://</literal> URL.
      And maintaining multiple server processes for your Subversion
      repositories is likely to be more of a headache than necessary.
      We recommend that you choose a single server that best meets your
      needs and stick with it!</para>

      <title>The svn+ssh:// Server Checklist</title>

      <para>It can be quite tricky to get a bunch of users with
        existing SSH accounts to share a repository without
        permissions problems.  If you're confused about all the things
        that you (as an administrator) need to do on a Unix-like
        system, here's a quick checklist that resummarizes some of the
        topics discussed in this section:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All of your SSH users need to be able to read and
            write to the repository, so put all the SSH users into a
            single group.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Make the repository wholly owned by that group.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Set the group permissions to read/write.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Your users need to use a sane umask when accessing the
            repository, so make sure <command>svnserve</command>
            (<filename>/usr/bin/svnserve</filename>, or wherever it
            lives in <literal>$PATH</literal>) is actually a wrapper
            script that runs <userinput>umask 002</userinput> and
            executes the real <command>svnserve</command>
            binary.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Take similar measures when using
            <command>svnlook</command> and
            <command>svnadmin</command>.  Either run them with a sane
            umask or wrap them as just described.</para>
