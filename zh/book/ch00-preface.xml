    In the world of open source software, the Concurrent
    Versions System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control
    for many years.  And rightly so.  CVS was open source software
    itself, and its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for
    networked operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed
    programmers to share their work.  It fit the collaborative nature
    of the open source world very well.  CVS and its semi-chaotic
    development model have since become cornerstones of open source
    culture.</para>

  在开源软件世界, 并发版本控制系统 (Concurrent Versions System, CVS) 长久以
  来一直是版本控制工具的唯一选择. 事实证明这个选择不错, CVS 的自由软件身份,
  无约束的处事态度, 和对网络化操作的支持 (网络使众多身处不同地方的程序可以
  共享他们的工作成果), 正符合了开源世界协作的精神, CVS 和它半混乱的开发模式
  已经成为开源文化的基石.</para>

  <para>But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those
    flaws promised to be an enormous effort.  Enter Subversion.
    Subversion was designed to be a successor to CVS, and its
    originators set out to win the hearts of CVS users in two
    ways&mdash;by creating an open source system with a design
    (and <quote>look and feel</quote>) similar to CVS, and by
    attempting to avoid most of CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the
    result wasn't&mdash;and isn't&mdash;the next great evolution in
    version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very

      一旦决定好了你确实需要一个版本控制系统, 你将发现可选择的工具非常丰富.

      <firstterm>集中式的版本控制</firstterm>
      (<firstterm>centralized version control</firstterm>)&mdash;有一个远程
      的主仓库, 仓库中存放了被版本控制的数据, 用户在本地操作数据的浅拷贝副本.
      Subversion 发布后, 很快就显现出它在版本控制领域的领导地位, 它的使用范围

        Much has changed since that time, though.  In the
        years since the Subversion project began its life, a newer
        methodology of version control called <firstterm>distributed
        version control</firstterm> has likewise garnered widespread
        attention and adoption.  Tools such as Git
        (<ulink url="http://git-scm.com/" />) and Mercurial
        (<ulink url="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" />) have risen
        to the tops of the distributed version control system (DVCS)
        ranks.  Distributed version control harnesses the growing
        ubiquity of high-speed network connections and low storage
        costs to offer an approach which differs from the centralized
        model in key ways.  First and most obvious is the fact that
        there is no remote, central storehouse of versioned data.
        Rather, each user keeps and operates against very
        deep&mdash;complete, in a sense&mdash;local version history
        data stores.  Collaboration still occurs, but is accomplished
        by trading collections of changes made to versioned items
        directly between users' local data stores, not via a
        centralized master data store.  TODO: In fact, any semblance of a
        canonical <quote>master</quote> source of a project's
        versioned data is by convention only, a status imputed by
        the various collaborators on that project.</para>

      从那时起也发生了很多事情. 在 Subversion 开始的那一年, 一种新的版本控制
      策略&mdash;<firstterm>分布式的版本控制</firstterm>
      (<firstterm>distributed version control</firstterm>)&mdash;开始受到越来
      越多的关注, 应用也越来越广泛. 一些版本控制工具, 例如 Git
      (<ulink url="http://git-scm.com/" />) 和 Mercurial
      (<ulink url="http://mercurial-scm.org/" />) 成为了分布式版本控制系统
      (DVCS) 的宠儿. 分布式的版本控制利用不断提高的网络连接速度和低廉的存储
      开销, 提出了一种和集中式模型完全不同的方法. 首先最明显的区别是它们不
      需要一个远程的中央仓库, 每一个用户在本地都有一份完整的版本历史. 用户
      之间仍然需要协作, 但不需要通过一台中央节点, 可以直接进行交互.

    <!--
      <para>There are pros and cons to each version control approach.
        Perhaps the two biggest benefits delivered by the DVCS tools
        are incredible performance for day-to-day operations (because
        the primary data store is locally held) and vastly better
        support for merging between branches (because merge algorithms
        serve as the very core of how DVCSes work at all).  The
        downside is that distributed version control is an inherently
        more complicated model, which can present a non-negligible
        challenge to comfortable collaboration.  Also, DVCS tools do
        what they do well in part because of a certain degree of
        control withheld from the user which centalized systems freely
        offer&mdash;the ability to implement path-based access
        control, the flexibility to update or backdate individual
        versioned data items, etc.  Fortunately, many wise
        organizations have discovered that this needn't be a religious
        debate, and that Subversion and a DVCS tool such as Git can be
        used together harmoniously within the organization, each
        serving the purposes best suited to the tool.</para>

      <para>每一种版本控制系统都有它自己的长处和短处. 也许 DVCS 的两个最
        大的好处是日常操作非常高效 (因为所有的数据都在本地存放) 和更强大
        分支合并 (因为合并算法是 DVCS 的核心). 缺点是分布式的版本控制更加
        复杂, 这种复杂性可能会给协作带来不小的挑战. 另外, DVCS 工具工作得
        很好, 部分是因为本来由中央系统持有的控制权&mdash;基于路径的访问控制,
        对单个项目 (item) 进行更新或回溯等&mdash;转移到了用户手止. 幸运的是,
        许多明智的组织已经发现没必要对两种版本控制系统进行宗教上的辩论,

      <para>In February 2000, they contacted Karl Fogel, the author of
        <citetitle>Open Source Development with CVS</citetitle>
        (Coriolis, 1999), and asked if he'd like to work on this new
        project.  Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already
        discussing a design for a new version control system with his
        friend Jim Blandy.  In 1995, the two had started Cyclic
        Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and
        although they later sold the business, they still used CVS
        every day at their jobs.  Their frustration with CVS had led
        Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned
        data, and he'd already come up with not only the Subversion
        name, but also the basic design of the Subversion data store.
        When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the
        project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to
        essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period
        of time.  CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and
        detailed design work began in May 2000.  With the help of some
        well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of
        CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time an independent
        developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process),
        Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers.
        It turned out that many people had encountered the same
        frustrating experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to
        finally do something about it.</para>
    -->
      <para>2000 年 2 月, CollabNet 联系到
        <citetitle>Open Source Development with CVS</citetitle> (Coriolis,
        1999) 的作者 Karl Fogel, 询问他是否愿意为这个新项目工作. 巧合的是,
        当时 Karl 正在和朋友 Jim Blandy 讨论设计一个新的版本控制系统. 1995 年
        他们曾经开办了一个提供 CVS 支持的公司 Cyclic Software, 尽管他们最终
        卖掉了公司, 但还是经常使用 CVS 进行日常工作. 使用 CVS 的挫折促使
        Jim 认真地思考如何管理版本化的数据. 他当是不仅使用了名字 Subversion,
        而且已经完成了版本库的最初设计. 所以当 CollabNet 提出邀请时, Karl
        马上同意为这个项目工作, 同时 Jim 也得到了他的雇主&mdash;Red Hat 软件
        公司&mdash;的同意, 允许他到为这个项目工作, 并且没有限定期限. CollabNet
        雇佣了 Karl 和 Ben Collins-Sussman, 详细设计从 2000 年 5 月开始,
        在 CollabNet 的 Brian Behlendorf 和 Jason Robbins, 以及 Greg
        Stein (独立开发者, 参与了 WebDAV/DeltaV 规范的制订) 的恰到好处的激励
        下, Subversion 吸引到了众多开发者的注意, 结果是许多对 CVS 有过失望
        经历的人都很乐意为这个项目做些事情.</para>
  
    <!--
      <para>The original design team settled on some simple goals.  They
        didn't want to break new ground in version control methodology,
        they just wanted to fix CVS.  They decided that Subversion would
        match CVS's features and preserve the same development model,
        but not duplicate CVS's most obvious flaws.  And although it did
        not need to be a drop-in replacement for CVS, it should be
        similar enough that any CVS user could make the switch with
        little effort.</para>
    -->
      <para>最初的设计小组设计了几个简单的开发目标. 他们不想在版本控制方法
        学中开垦处女地, 他们只想修正 CVS. 他们决定 Subversion 应该符合 CVS
        的特征, 保留相同的开发模式, 但不能包含 CVS 的显著缺陷. 尽管 Subversion
        不必成为 CVS 的完全替代品, 但这应该与 CVS 保持足够的相似性, 使得
        CVS 用户可以轻松地迁移到 Subversion.</para>
  
    <!--
      <para>After 14 months of coding, Subversion became
        <quote>self-hosting</quote> on August 31, 2001.  That is,
        Subversion developers stopped using CVS to manage Subversion's
        own source code and started using Subversion instead.</para>
    -->
      <para>经过 14 个月的编码, 在 2001 年 8 月 31 日, Subversion 实现了

        While CollabNet started the project, and still
        funds a large chunk of the work (it pays the salaries of a few
        full-time Subversion developers), Subversion is run like most
        open source projects, governed by a loose, transparent set of
        rules that encourage meritocracy.  In 2009, CollabNet worked
        with the Subversion developers towards the goal of integrating
        the Subversion project into the Apache Software Foundation
        (ASF), one of the most well-known collectives of open source
        projects in the world.  Subversion's technical roots,
        community priorities, and development practices were a perfect
        fit for the ASF, many of whose members were already active
        Subversion contributors.  In early 2010, Subversion was fully
        adopted into the ASF's family of top-level projects, moved its
        project web presence to
        <ulink url="http://subversion.apache.org"/>, and was
        rechristened <quote>Apache Subversion</quote>.</para>
    -->
      虽然 CollabNet 发起了这个项目, 而且仍然提供资金支持 (为一些全职的
      Subversion 开发者提供薪水), 但 Subversion 像其他许多开源项目一样,
      由一套松散透明, 鼓励能者多劳的规则管理. 2009 年, CollabNet 和 Subversion
      开发人员合作, 把 Subversion 项目纳入 Apache Software Foundation
      (ASF)&mdash;世界著名的开源项目集合. Subversion 的技术根基, 社区和开发工
      作同 ASF 非常契合, ASF 的很多成员同时也是 Subversion 的活跃贡献者.
      2010 年, Subversion 成为了 ASF 的顶级项目之一, 其项目主页迁移至
      <ulink url="http://subversion.apache.org"/>, Subversion 被重新命名为
      <quote>Apache Subversion</quote>.</para>

        1.0.  Since that time, the Subversion project has continued to
        release new major releases of the software.  Here's a quick
        summary of major new changes since Subversion 1.0.  Note that

          <term>Subversion 1.1 (September 2004)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.1 introduced FSFS, a flat-file repository
              storage option for the repository.  While the Berkeley DB
              backend is still widely used and supported, FSFS has
              since become the default choice for
              newly created repositories due to its low barrier to
              entry and minimal maintenance requirements.  Also in
              this release came the ability to put symbolic links
              under version control, auto-escaping of URLs, and a
              localized user interface.</para>

          <term>Subversion 1.2 (May 2005)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.2 introduced the ability to create
              server-side locks on files, thus serializing commit
              access to certain resources.  While Subversion is still
              a fundamentally concurrent version control system,
              certain types of binary files (e.g. art assets)
              cannot be merged together.  The locking feature fulfills
              the need to version and protect such resources.  With
              locking also came a complete WebDAV auto-versioning
              implementation, allowing Subversion repositories to be
              mounted as network folders.  Finally, Subversion 1.2
              began using a new, faster binary-differencing algorithm
              to compress and retrieve old versions of files.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.3 brought path-based authorization
              controls to the <command>svnserve</command> server,
              matching a feature formerly found only in the Apache
              server.  The Apache server, however, gained some new
              logging features of its own, and Subversion's API
              bindings to other languages also made great leaps
              forward.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.4 introduced a whole new
              tool&mdash;<command>svnsync</command>&mdash;for doing
              one-way repository replication over a network.  Major
              parts of the working copy metadata were revamped to no
              longer use XML (resulting in client-side speed gains),
              while the Berkeley DB repository backend gained the
              ability to automatically recover itself after a server
              crash.</para>

          <term>Subversion 1.5 (June 2008)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.5 took much longer to finish than prior
              releases, but the headliner feature was gigantic:
              semi-automated tracking of branching and merging.  This
              was a huge boon for users, and pushed Subversion far
              beyond the abilities of CVS and into the ranks of
              commercial competitors such as Perforce and ClearCase.
              Subversion 1.5 also introduced a bevy of other
              user-focused features, such as interactive resolution of
              file conflicts, sparse checkouts, client-side
              management of changelists, powerful new syntax for
              externals definitions, and SASL authentication support for
              the <command>svnserve</command> server.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.6 continued to make branching and merging
              more robust by introducing tree conflicts, and offered
              improvements to several other existing features: more
              interactive conflict resolution options; de-telescoping
              and outright exclusion support for sparse checkouts;
              file-based externals definitions; and operational
              logging support for <command>svnserve</command> similar
              to what <command>mod_dav_svn</command> offered.  Also,
              the command-line client introduced a new shortcut syntax
              for referring to Subversion repository URLs.</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Subversion 1.7 (October 2011)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.7 was primarily a delivery vehicle for two
              big plumbing overhauls of existing Subversion
              components.  The largest and most impactful of these was
              the so-called <quote>WC-NG</quote>&mdash;a complete
              rewrite of the <command>libsvn_wc</command> working copy
              management library.  The second change was the
              introduction of a sleeker HTTP protocol for Subversion
              client/server interaction.  Subversion 1.7 delivered a
              handful of additional features, many bug fixes, and some
              notable performance improvements, too.</para>

          <term>Subversion 1.8 (June 2013)</term>
          <listitem>

            <para>In release 1.8, Subversion's client now tracks
              renamed files and directories more thoroughly, and
              its <command>svn merge</command> command has grown
              intelligent enough to make the
              <option>--reintegrate</option> option unnecessary.
              Certain new versioned property values can be inherited
              from parent directories.  That feature now allows a
              repository to dictate default values for automatic
              property settings and ignorable file patterns, bringing
              consistency across the user base of that repository in a
              way which previously had to be managed socially.  There
              is also a new built-in command-line file merge tool for
              interactive conflict resolution.  As always, Subversion
              1.8 includes many additional features, defect fixes, and
              improvements in behavior and performance.</para>

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line-based.  That command-line tool
      (<command>svn</command>), and some additional auxiliary
      programs, are the focus of this book.</para>

    <para>For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader
      is using a Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable
      with Unix and command-line interfaces.  That said, the
      <command>svn</command> program also runs on non-Unix platforms
      such as Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor exceptions, such as
      the use of backward slashes (<literal>\</literal>) instead of
      forward slashes (<literal>/</literal>) for path separators, the
      input to and output from this tool when run on Windows are
      identical to that of its Unix counterpart.</para>

    <para>Most readers are probably programmers or system
      administrators who need to track changes to source code.  This
      is the most common use for Subversion, and therefore it is the
      scenario underlying all of the book's examples.  But Subversion
      can be used to manage changes to any sort of
      information&mdash;images, music, databases, documentation, and
      so on.  To Subversion, all data is just data.</para>
    
    <para>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used a version control system, we've also tried
      to make it easy for users of CVS (and other systems) to make a
      painless leap into Subversion.  Special sidebars may mention
      other version control systems from time to time, and
      <xref linkend="svn.forcvs"/> summarizes many of the differences
      between CVS and Subversion.</para>

    <para>Note also that the source code examples used throughout the
      book are only examples.  While they will compile with the proper
      compiler incantations, they are intended to illustrate a
      particular scenario and not necessarily to serve as examples of good
      programming style or practices.</para>

    <para>Technical books always face a certain dilemma: whether to
      cater to <quote>top-down</quote> or to <quote>bottom-up</quote>
      learners.  A top-down learner prefers to read or skim
      documentation, getting a large overview of how the system works;
      only then does she actually start using the software.  A
      bottom-up learner is a <quote>learn by doing</quote>
      person&mdash;someone who just wants to dive into the software
      and figure it out as she goes, referring to book sections when
      necessary.  Most books tend to be written for one type of person
      or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased toward
      top-down learners.  (And if you're actually reading this
      section, you're probably already a top-down learner yourself!)
      However, if you're a bottom-up person, don't despair.  While the
      book may be laid out as a broad survey of Subversion topics, the
      content of each section tends to be heavy with specific examples
      that you can try-by-doing.  For the impatient folks who just
      want to get going, you can jump right to
      <xref linkend="svn.intro"/>.</para>

    <para>Regardless of your learning style, this book aims to be
      useful to people of widely different backgrounds&mdash;from
      those with no previous experience in version control to
      experienced system administrators.  Depending on your own
      background, certain chapters may be more or less important to
      you.  The following can be considered a
      <quote>recommended reading list</quote> for various types of
      readers:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Experienced system administrators</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The assumption here is that you've probably used
            version control before and are dying to get a
            Subversion server up and running ASAP.
            <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin"/> and
            <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/> will show you how to
            create your first repository and make it available over
            the network.  After that's done,
            <xref linkend="svn.tour"/> and
            <xref linkend="svn.forcvs"/> are the fastest routes to
            learning the Subversion client.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>New users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Your administrator has probably set up Subversion
            already, and you need to learn how to use the client.  If
            you've never used a version control system, then
            <xref linkend="svn.basic"/> is a vital introduction to the
            ideas behind version control.  <xref linkend="svn.tour"/>
            is a guided tour of the Subversion client.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Advanced users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually
            your project will grow larger.  You're going to want to
            learn how to do more advanced things with Subversion, such
            as how to use Subversion's property support
            (<xref linkend="svn.advanced"/>), how to use branches and
            perform merges (<xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>), how to
            configure runtime options
            (<xref linkend="svn.customization"/>), and other things.
            These chapters aren't critical at first, but be sure to
            read them once you're comfortable with the basics.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Developers</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion,
            and now want to either extend it or build new software on
            top of its many APIs.  <xref linkend="svn.developer"/> is
            just for you.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The book ends with reference material&mdash;<xref
      linkend="svn.ref"/> is a reference guide for all Subversion
      commands, and the appendixes cover a number of useful topics.
      These are the chapters you're most likely to come back to
      after you've finished the book.</para>

    <para>This book started out as bits of documentation written by
      Subversion project developers, which were then coalesced into a
      single work and rewritten.  As such, it has always been under a
      free license (see <xref linkend="svn.copyright"/>).  In fact,
      the book was written in the public eye, originally as part of
      the Subversion project itself.  This means two things:</para>

    <para>This book would not be possible (nor very useful) if
      Subversion did not exist.  For that, the authors would like to
      thank Brian Behlendorf and CollabNet for the vision to fund such
      a risky and ambitious new open source project; Jim Blandy for
      the original Subversion name and design&mdash;we love you, Jim;
      and Karl Fogel for being such a good friend and a great

    <para>Thanks to O'Reilly and the team of professional editors who
      have helped us polish this text at various stages of its
      evolution: Chuck Toporek, Linda Mui, Tatiana Apandi, Mary Brady,
      and Mary Treseler.  Your patience and support has been
      tremendous.</para>

    <para>Finally, we thank the countless people who contributed to
      this book with informal reviews, suggestions, and patches.  An
      exhaustive listing of those folks' names would be impractical to
      print and maintain here, but may their names live on forever in
