This directory contains dumps of the sample repositories used in the book's
examples.

ch04-sample-repos.dump:

While the logs, mergeinfo, path names, and merge history all agree with the
chapter 4 "paint" and "calc" examples, the actual file contents are
nonsensical -- the file contents are from
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk. So if future examples
require an explicit diff, you'll need to "fake" it.
